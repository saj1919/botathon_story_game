every time we embrace,
i go to that far away place
when we just walk hand in hand.
i'm in never, never land.
whenever i look into your eyes,
i begin to get butterflies,
then my heart skips a beat,
and our lips passionately meet.
you are always on my mind,
your face is all it can find.
i think about you every day
a better tomorrow
i never knew there would be a better tomorrow
but you've come into my life and taken away all my sorrow
my days of sadness are a thing of the past
because i have found true love at last
my days of emptiness are gone for good
because you fill a void in my heart that you should
you've opened a window
you've shown me the light
and my love for you will continue to burn bright.

a blue star in your eyes
on the wings of an eagle,
my love for you flies.
soaring higher and higher,
and touching the skies.
i reached up above,
and pulled a star from the sky.
to place it within,
your precious minds eye.
to dwell there forever,
as my love for you.
on the wings of our love,
enduring and true.
i honor you my darling,
with all that i am.
please darling please,
will you be my man?
there are so many things,
my heart wants to say.
i love you sweetheart,
there is no other way.

a brand new day
rest your head and close your eyes
everything will be okay
for when you wake with the sweet sunrise
it will be a brand new day
turn down the lights and pull me close
feel only the beating of our hearts as we lay
for when you wake with the soft morning breeze
it will be a brand new day.
relax your body and caress my soft hair
let all of life's worries melt away
for when you wake with the warm summer scent
it will be a brand new day
fall fast asleep and dream with me
whisper "i love you, i'm here to stay"
for when we wake in each other's arms
it will be a brand new day.
a breathtaking fantasy
my dearest, here i am planning
a trip down the lane to the sea,
in august as the sun is shining
and you're there to comfort me.
a breathtaking fantasy.
over the fields we will ramble
picking fruit from god's bramble
soft fruit for jelly & blackberry pie,
oh happy day ~ sing i, sing i,
as my eyes point up to the sky.
we should be well-nourished
with his gift of the purest,
edible berries, and vitamin "c"
giving us strength and vitality,
ever to be in love you see.
my dearest, here i am planning
a breathtaking trip to the sea,
down lover's lane so beguiling,
berries will grow wild and free.

a dreamer of dreams
you have come to me from a distant land,
dreamer of dreams, to fill my hearts desire,
sweet music flowing from your nimble hand
that plays within... to light my passion's fire.
a symphony of word and thought you bring.
excitement builds upon crescendo's sound,
brought forth in tones to make my light heart sing
for all the beauty that, with you, i've found.
a life is changed in just an instant's time,
all darkness fled before that brillaint sun
that shines from spoken words of softest rhyme
and speaks of treasures, only just begun.
this mystic meeting gives my heart a glow
that few have seen and only you will know.
my love is like the sun that warms me when i am cold,
and like the cool water of the brook that refreshes me.
my love knows the secret pleasures of my soul,
and delights with me in fulfilling them.
who is my love but the soul of my soul,
and the reason for every beat of my heart.
who fills me with life in the joy of her presence,
and returns to me more than i have given.
come to me, my love, i die without you.
each day is eternity, waiting for your touch.
remove the tears from my eyes and the ache in my heart,
be closer than my breath, all my days, all my nights.
a cute poem for a cute girl
you changed my world with a blink of an eye
that is something that i can not deny
you put my soul from worst to best
that is why i treasure you my dearest marites
you just don't know what you have done for me
you even pushed me to the best that i can be
you really are an angel sent from above
to take care of me and shower with love
when i'm with you i will not cry even a single a tear
and your touch have chased away all of my fear
you have given me a life that i could live worthwhile
it is even better everytime you smile
it so magical those things you've made
to bring back my faith that almost fade
now my life is a dream come true
it all began when i was loved by you
now i have found what i am looking for
it's you and your love and nothing more
co'z you have given me this feeling of contentment
in my life something i've never felt
i wish i could talk 'til the end of day
but now i'm running out of things to say
so i'll end by the line you already know
"i love you" more than what i could show.
a fine romance
one day, your arms will possess me,
one day, you will ask for my hand,
one day, the ring will be shining,
in the sun as we walk thro' the sand.
one day, romance will caress me,
one day, the church bells will chime,
and we will go cruising together forever
for the love of my dreams will be mine.
most romantic movies
a gentle touch
a gentle brush of his fingers,
sending shivers down my spine.
in the love i see in his eyes,
is a love that equals mine.
he greets me with a smile,
and leaves me with a kiss.
if he were to ever leave me,
i couldn't imagine what i'd miss.
maybe it's his touch,
or the way he makes me feel.
but whatever it is,
i'm head over heels.
a gorgeous pleasant surprise
you came into my life so quick,
a gorgeous pleasant surprise,
i hoped you wouldn't give me the flick,
then, a beautiful friendship did arise.
our bond was so very strong,
it couldn't help but turn into love,
we wondered if going further was wrong,
but we fit each other like a glove.
it feels so right to be so near,
to feel like we are but one,
sometimes our love is worth a tear,
those tears of joy, i'm sure there are more to come
it really is love, my baby,
the longing for one anothers lips,
you are my beautiful young lady,
i know it as we dance with my hands upon your hips.
a heart of stone
once i had a heart of stone
for it had surley lost its home
it could not love or wanted too
but in my life, then came you.
the stones began to fall away
as happiness began to fill my day
a feeling so sweet and special too
could this be love, i pray is true.
my heart now sings a song of love
for i know that it was  sent from above
my heart is warm, there is no cold
hard no more, but with wings of gold.
it soars above the sky so high
sometimes i think of why and cry
my heart now sings a loving song
for the part of me i thought was gone.
the gift that you have given me
is so important, can't you see
no more sadness or being alone
for now my heart returns to home.
a knight in shining armor
in this world full of hurt and pain,
i need someone who would help me through the rain.
to comfort me when im sad,
doing everything just to make me glad.
in this world i need a brave knight,
who would never give up any fight.
a knight who would dry away my tears,
telling me to overcome my fears.
a knight who loves me for who i am inside,
with him there's nothing more i need to hide.
a person who will still be standing strong,
eventhough everything has gone wrong.
i need someone who is willing to give me more,
someone i can call my knight in shining armor.
a new life was waiting
inviting - exciting - emotion
with power i had never known,
a world of unchained devotion
because you were my very own.
i had fallen in love with you.
together we sailed in springtime
to an isle beyond seas of blue,
and when we returned, a new life
was waiting, in a valley of dreams
where i first fell in love with you.
i lie on the ground,
and stare into space,
the stars start to move,
into the shape of your face.
i see you there now,
looking down at me,
with that cute little smile,
that i like to see.
you say "close your eyes",
"tell me what you see",
i see only two people,
just you and me.
we're walking the shoreline,
with our feet getting wet,
the horizon turns pink,
as the sun starts to set.
we make love through the night,
on that white sandy shore,
then i hold you while thinking,
i could want nothing more.
oh i wish i could be,
in that one special place,
as i lie on the ground,
and i stare into space.
all because of you
i awake each day with a smile
and greet it with a laugh;
the world is a treasure to me
because of you.
every time i think of something sad,
i replace the thought - with you!
my mind is instantly changed
and my heart is filled with gladness.
every breath i take is meant for you,
i live this life surrounded in joy
and i bathe in the promise of your love,
my soul belongs to you.
each time i see something beautiful
i want to take it and bring it to you;
my life has so much meaning now
all because of you.
all dreamers understand
our love was a romantic book
from the sacred day we met,
your gentle charm enthralled me
from then-on the scene was set:
a sunny day, a rainy day,
it mattered not to me,
if i could see your happy face
and walk and talk with thee.
when snow was falling from the sky
and chilly breezes blew,
were it not for your embrace
i'd pine the whole day through.
so now we are alone my love
i offer you my hand,
to join with yours in wedlock
as all "dreamers" understand.
all i can't say
there are so many words i cannot say,
when i look into your eyes.
i want to be able to tell you one day,
but i'm left speechless every time that i try.
you must have stumbled across the key,
and discovered so much more.
you found a hidden place in me,
you found my heart and opened the door.
and i cried in pain
of losing my dear friend.
will it ever be the same again?
if it passes will it be the end?
i realized it was worth so much,
as i lie in bed that night.
so i allowed my soul to be touched,
without even putting up a fight.
are my eyes deceiving me,
when i see you standing there?
are you playing games,
just to prove i care?
you speak my name in a prelude,
in a reference to love,
with such loving attitude,
as if it were a message from above.
with the palms of your hands
pressed firmly against mine,
a white doves lands,
and the sun begins to shine.
someday i will see,
though that day has not come yet.
you'll say you love me,
but will you ever forget?
if that happens and my spirit dies,
if my emotions drop,
will you want to hold me when i cry?
or will the love just suddenly stop?
we can't expect to fall in love and never cry.
you'll stay and play your part,
but after the beauty starts to die,
will your footprints still be on my heart?
though it would be hard to say goodbye,
your friend i'll always be,
as long as we always try,
to keep the friendship between you and me.
the letter i will not send
will casually inquire,
how could you have brought it to an end?
i was your one desire.
after this life is over,
you'll be one person i know i'll miss.
it'll be too late to start over, and so i leave you with this...
i'll hold you for a lifetime,
if you'll just hold my hand.
we could have a wonderful time,
in the days we have not yet planned.
all i have to give
you're the first thing i think of
each morning when i rise.
you're the last thing i think of
each night when i close my eyes.
you're in each thought i have
and every breath i take.
my feelings are growing stronger
with every move i make.
i want to prove i love you
but that's the hardest part.
so, i'm giving all i have to give
to you... i give my heart.
all i see is you
i remember us,
the way we used to be,
i'd hold you in my arms,
your smile so sweet to me,
but now when i see you,
you look right through me,
i feel so alone now,
but when i close my eyes...
...all i see is you.
the love we used to share,
gone up in whirl winds,
will i ever love,
or ever live again,
i am tired of crying,
and i am done trying,
to remember all about you,
but when i close my eyes...
...all i see is you.
all the love i am sending,
the memories i won't sell,
i know there must be an ending,
to the story i will tell,
i dream only of your love,
and happiness in life,
i try not to think of you,
but when i close my eyes...
...all i see is you.
all my life
it was not so long ago
when i thought i'd never meet someone like you.
wrong was i, thinking i'm in control
believing i'd never fall.
all my life i thought no one would
melt a heart like mine, a heart so cold,
a heart hardened by the past,
protected by shields so vast.
slowly i was falling
without even knowing.
only to find out too late
i have no choice but to accept my fate.
i could dream, i suppose
forever, i could hope
there will never be any 'us', that's our destiny
so i wake up to reality.
i lied when i said
i didn't love you,
that my feelings for you
not because i wanted to
but because i love you
and i still do.
i wouldn't do a thing to hurt you
but i just have to let go.
i can't hold on much longer
'coz for us there's no forever.
all of you
the sound of your voice is music to my ear
so soft, sweet, and clear
the kiss from your lips words can not explain
it takes away my worries and my pain
the caress of your hand sends shivers down my spine
everyday i thank god that your mine.
the sight of your lovely face takes away all my fears
you're the one i want to love through out the years
for an eternity i want to spend in your arms
everyday graced by your beauty and your charms.
all over again
last night i fell in love with you
all over again,
more deeply in love,
than ever before.
no one has ever expressed their love for me
with such beautiful and kind words.
last night i fell in love with you
all over again,
with such stronger faith
than ever before.
knowing that you will always be there for me
when dark shadows enter my life.
last night i  fell in love with you
all over again
with a stronger friendship
than ever before
when ever i need a tender shoulder to cry on
i know you will wipe away the tears
last night i feel in love with you
all over again
with more respect
than ever before
i look up to you and admire your strength
in turn you have strengthen me
last i feel in love with you
all over again
with such care
than ever before
now i truly believe how much you care for me
you have given me life.
last night i fell in love with you
all over again
with more happiness
than ever before
you have brought back to me smiles and laughter
through your loving eyes.
last night i fell in love with you
all over again
with more love
than ever before
for the first time in a long time
i have really felt love.
a loving peace from you
from the glowing embers of your spirit
came a little warmth of your love
together we set it in a cozy little spot
safe from the world up above
then a soothing breath from your lungs
helped to ignite the flame
on that lonely candle
in the core of my soul
as time passed day by day
conflicts caused great winds to blow
but you cupped your hands around it
and it just flickered with a brilliant glow
they say that nothing is forever
but i don't believe that's true
that little candle in my heart
is a loving peace from you
i took your love for granted,
could not see through my blind eyes,
i did not know how much i loved you,
now, in pain, i realize.
you've found someone, i know you, love,
but the flame you lit burns on,
i've really got to let you go,
i must accept... you're gone.
i wish i could just rewind time
to how it was before,
but however much she loves you now,
i will always love you more.
always and forever
basking in the warmth of your smile
and the music of your laugh
i feel your tenderness
and your oh so witty style
always and forever
as i write, i'll sing this song
for the greatest love i've ever known.
to my heart, you have the only key,
i beg of you, never set me free.
i prayed to god for a love so true
now, i, realize he already knew.
in time my prayer was answered,
the most wonderful woman
he blessed me with you.
what we share feels so right
to say i love you every night.
wonderful moments shared,
precious memories, still tell me you care.
i see your shadow,
as i lay myself to sleep.
dreams of you, oh so sweet
in my heart, i will keep.
look into my heart, my life.
tell me, what do you see?
can you feel the need, the want, as i
to be your husband, you my wife.
much joy and happiness you've brought me.
if i had life to live again, i'd want to with you,
my lover, my best friend.
always and forever, i'll love you till the end.
as i lay in the darkness,
i wait for her to free me,
free me from my fears, my worries,
time slows down when she is near,
for she is the key that opens the lock,
the one that holds the chains down on me.
i am finally set free, but i am empty inside,
i cannot find a way through this lonely life of mine,
for i cannot find my heart,
it was lost in time, torn to pieces,
the same one i left open to the world.
i am now with her, my heroin, my savior,
she has found the pieces,
one by one she puts them together,
i will never feel lonely again,
for she has given me a reason,
a reason to keep living, a reason to never give up love.
send this poem to a friend
a million times
i have seen you a million times
and every time i see you
i fall in love with you all over again
my heart starts to race
my frown turns into a smile
and all my worries are now in my past
when you smile at me my heart melts
you give the sweetest hugs
every time you hug me
your smile is like a new day
your sense of humor is like no other
the ability you have to make me smile
is all you need you love me
your laugh is so soft and sweet
just looking in your eyes
makes me melt inside
your lips look so soft
soft enough to kiss
you, yourself relive me from all pain
your hands are as soft as a pillow
the way you comfort me is amazing
every time we say good-bye
i start to cry
i say good-bye to you too many times
i said good-bye to you a million times.
a moment to remember
a place we go
to let us know
that our love is always true
and that we will never be blue.
a memory on the edge of time
a place where we are so sublime,
a distant dream on a midnights eve
somewhere far from acknowledged leaves.
a time in which we fell deeper in love
just like to turtle doves.
we sang our songs and gave our token
to remember one single moment.
am i crazy or is this love?
it seems you were sent straight to me from above
your smile is bright enough to bring the day
your eyes so blue, i just have to say
there couldn't be anything more perfect in one place
your beauty is much deeper than just your face
they say love takes time but yet . . . .
it feels as if we've already met
it feels like we were meant to be
together forever . . . you and me
an angel's crime
an angel tantalizes me with heaven's fire,
to covet a life just beyond my grasp.
years paint the path of forbidden desire,
as his wings burn my skin.
woe to you, forbidden angel,
oh blissful agony drown my cries,
expose my souls ravenous despair,
gratify me with your wings afire.
angel from above
you are an angel from above,
you are the one whom i love,
i hope that we never will part,
you'll always have a place in my heart.
and that place is first, not last.
god, the days fly by so fast.
there's not a moment i dont think about you
i know i will cry if we are ever through
so please don't leave me,
my love, please don't deceive me.
an angel to me
the moment i opened my heart and let you in
i saw this great love starting to begin.
i opened my eyes to a vision of you
i hope, i pray your feelings are true.
i have loved and i have paid the cost
and i have felt the pain of the love i lost.
but, now, i think i have truly found
an angel who walks upon the ground.
you go beyond all limits for me
just to show your love endlessly.
i could search my whole life through
and never find another 'you'.
you are so special that i wanted you to know
i truly, completely love you so.
an enslaved love
dreams, drifting, deepened and watered,
lonesome, sunken and so battered,
cast away like dead mans corpse,
shipwrecked on lifes long mysterious course,
crying, raging from the soul within,
for a love lost, crushed and aching.
clinging to a life that knows no care,
im sinking beneath a million tears,
captured, enslaved and compelled by a love
that only your heart can free me of
a love thats saddened and filled with fear,
to be enriched by your loves sweet tear.
send this poem to a friend
angel and her lover
the lover sleeps and amid his dreams
his angel comes on sunlit beams.
to waken him with kisses sweet,
for her love for him is oh so deep.
she wakes him with her caresses light
upon his skin and smiles so bright.
and in her eyes, he sees the love
she feels for him neath stars above.
he comes to her to gently place,
kisses upon her neck and face.
to caress her body and touch her soul.
for together two become a whole.
the love they make is deep and true
and in this embrace their love renew.
when all is done and all's been said,
upon her breasts he rests his head.
and hears her heart beat for him alone.
a greater love, he's never known.
though star-blazed skies my mind contained,
the solitude of night my heart concealed,
love's emotions were so fully restrained,
thus did i hide behind a self-made shield.
and then you entered into my life,
bewildering feelings, dazed and confused,
but you continued deeper like a knife,
until my hardness was thus subdued.
what i never thought possible for me,
you've done and that i'll always treasure,
my heart burns fervent with love for thee,
our souls delight in each beyond all measure.
and as you now place your sweet lips on mine,
i know for certain i'm enraptured with an angel divine.
angel from above
gazing into her eyes when we first met
i knew then she was heaven sent.
all i ever dreamed of, an angel from above.
she had no idea from the start
true love, i'd found in my heart.
one of a kind, love that lasts a lifetime
all i ever dreamed of, an angel from above.
still, her smile, my breath it takes away
wanting, needing, to hold her, so much to say.
all my prayers answered when into my life she came
to me, she is everything.
all i ever dreamed of, an angel from above.
like the moon, stars, morning sunrise
so much beauty, so much grace.
she's even more through my eyes.
all i ever dreamed of, an angel from above.
together, forever, i long to be
can you see, you're very precious and sweet.
the only one for me.
all i ever dreamed of, an angel from above.
your gentle words, your tender touch, life meaning so much
wrapped tightly in each others arms i wish to be.
with you, i feel so free.
a vow to you i made, forever, you'll have my love.
all i ever dreamed of, an angel from above.
angel of my life
i love you so much that words can't explain
this joy that i have for you.
when i am at the weakest point of my life
you are there encouraging me to run this race
because i am not only cause you are there with me.
you are on my mind day and night.
when we are apart i picture you gracious smile and gentle hug.
i can let my feelings out to you and won't regret it
because no matter what is you are always on my side.
i thank god for sending me someone like you who is precious and loving.
so i can truly say that you are the angel of my life!
angel in the night
you're my angel in the night
you're everything i think of
everything i dream of.
yours is the voice i hear when
the moon steals the day.
yours is the voice
i hear when the sun sneaks
in to warm me.
when my heart aches with lifes pains,
you are my angel.
i never expected someone like you.
someone kind and loving as you.
you snuck into my life like a true
angel in the night.
loving you is the only thing that
brought me this far.
cuz' your my angel in the night.
it was many and many a year ago,
in a kingdom by the sea,
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
by the name of annabel lee;
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me.
i was a child and she was a child,
in this kingdom by the sea;
but we loved with a love that was more than love -
i and my annabel lee;
with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me.
and this was the reason that, long ago,
in this kingdom by the sea,
a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
my beautiful annabel lee;
so that her highborn kinsman came
and bore her away from me,
to shut her up in a sepulcher
in this kingdom by the sea.
the angels, not half so happy in heaven,
went envying her and me
yes! that was the reason
(as all men know, in this kingdom by the sea)
that the wind came out of the cloud by night,
chilling and killing my annabel lee.
but our love was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we
of many far wiser than we
and neither the angels in heaven above,
nor the demons down under the sea,
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful annabel lee.
for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
of the beautiful annabel lee;
and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes
of the beautiful annabel lee;
and so, all the night-tide, i lie down by the side
of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
in the sepulcher there by the sea,
in her tomb by the sounding sea.
a passionate kiss
a passionate night between me and you
i can't begin to tell you the things i want to do.
first we can dim the lights and get closer.....
no, wait, that's too fast, let's go back
and move a little slower.
i'll kiss your lips that are so soft and sweet,
then move on to your cheek that's so smooth and unique.
then i'll move right along that little ear of yours...
whoa... my, my... let me move along your chest...
uh, oh i missed a spot, let me move back up to the neck
as i move my tongue around and around
you start to feel it as i go down slowly
and as i kiss your chest your hands go up
...but i'm not finished yet....
i go further down towards your navel...
as i move down past your waist line i begin to kiss....
oh, i just wake up to realize it's a dream !
a passionate dream fueled by my deep love for you.
a perfect companion
a silent ebony night
still no fear, no fright
coase i am not alone
there is someone who is known.
they are the tiny drops from the sky.
who are so pure that they connot deny
they quitely listen to all that we say
then, touch the earth or vanish in a bay.
i love to walk in the rain
cause no one can feel my pain.
no one can see me cry
cause tears mix with them and finally die.
i have zillions of such companions,
but still alone in the battalion.
fighting against fear and lonliness,
and fatigue of the ruthless passiveness.
will any one even come to ask?
to remove this fake cheerful mask.
or these descended fays are the only one,
to support me in this lonely run.
still my life leaves a question,
will anyone come to heal this repurcussion?
or i will also become like the drops from the sky,
and will mix with the earth and finally die.
lonely, lonely, lonely forever...
a poem for a special someone
you are my inspiration
having you in my life
revived my sleeping devotion
you are indeed a special someone
loving you gives me hope
to free this misery that i coped
in those times i gave up
you came and i stood up
never will i forget
how you always cheer me up
a red, red rose
o my luve's like a red, red rose.
that's newly sprung in june;
o my luve's like a melodie
that's sweetly played in tune.
as fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
so deep in luve am i;
and i will love thee still, my dear,
till a'the seas gang dry.
till a'the seas gang dry, my dear,
and the rocks melt wi' the sun;
i will luve thee still, my dear,
while the sands o'life shall run.
and fare thee weel my only luve!
and fare thee weel a while!
and i will come again, my luve,
tho' it were ten thousand mile!
romantic rose petals
a rose without you
with this rose, i not only give you merely a rose,
but i give you my heart and soul.
i send to you all the love i have to give,
and anything else that would give me the
chance to touch your heart.
with this rose, i reveal all my
thoughts and feelings about you
that i have withheld for so long.
i feel when i am with you... i am like a rose,
not because of it?s beauty,
but because i am able to bloom and grow with you.
to me you are like a rose's sunshine,
so full of energy and light,
that never does it fail to lift my spirits.
just by the sound of your voice and that look in your eye.
i could never tear my eyes from you,
you are able to make my life worth living.
but, without you, just like a rose,
i would wither and die.
not all at once, but little by little,
petal by petal.
slowly at first, because you have made me
stronger and stronger each day you're with me.
but eventually, without you, i will lose
all those beautiful petals you have given me.
a single rose of love
a single rose of love
a single rose of devotion
a single wish upon my lips
a single thought of you
a single desire to be granted
a single moment of careless bliss
a single love never to be broken
a single rose for one last kiss.
a special world
a special world for you and me
a special bond one cannot see
it wraps us up in its cocoon
and holds us fiercely in its womb.
its fingers spread like fine spun gold
gently nestling us to the fold
like silken thread it holds us fast
bonds like this are meant to last.
and though at times a thread may break
a new one forms in its wake
to bind us closer and keep us strong
in a special world, where we belong.
a tear on my pillow
when i lay and think, in my bed at night,
the day you'll arrive, seems nowhere in sight.
i toss and i turn, dreaming of you,
opening my eye's... checking if my dream came true.
it didn't, again, and a tear starts to roll,
weeping quietly... my pillow i hold.
many sleepless nights i've prayed for you, my love.
god touched my soul from heaven above
he's answered my prayers for my bride to be.
i've never felt this lucky, god did this for me.
that's a question i asked each and every night.
he must think your special, joy, and i know he's right.
no other has made me feel so complete,
my whole life was lived, just so we could meet.
all these thoughts and more going through my head.
i fall asleep not worrying, but dreaming of you... instead.
at last, when all the summer shine
that warmed life's early hours is past,
your loving fingers seek for mine
and hold them close at last at last!
not oft the robin comes to build
its nest upon the leafless bough
by autumn robbed, by winter chilled,
but you, dear heart, you love me now.
though there are shadows on my brow
and furrows on my cheek, in truth,
the marks where time's remorseless plough
broke up the blooming sward of youth,
though fled is every girlish grace
might win or hold a lover's vow,
despite my sad and faded face,
and darkened heart, you love me now!
i count no more my wasted tears;
they left no echo of their fall;
i mourn no more my lonesome years;
this blessed hour atones for all.
i fear not all that time or fate
may bring to burden heart or brow,
strong in the love that came so late,
our souls shall keep it always now!
a touch never felt
how can you ache and crave for someone's touch
when you have never felt it?
i do this for yours, though,
and the yearning grows more each day
i have never wanted anything in my life
as much as i want you
when you whisper such sweet love
in my ear when we talk
you make me melt into a puddle
of complete helplessness
you have become my every waking thought
and my every dream at night
i breathe in so hard
trying to catch my breath when we can't talk
i close my eyes so tight
hoping when i open them you will be there
but i know i have to wait
until the time is right
it seems so far away
that i think i am losing my mind
i want to breathe in your scent
and keep it with me all day long
i want to taste your love for me
by kissing your sweet lips
i want to feel your body next to me
so when you leave for awhile i can hold on
i just want you to know
that i really do love you
when the day comes and we are together
you will always know and feel this
i will always hug, kiss and love you
every moment of the day and night
...you will never have another touch unfelt
a whisper sweet
basket full of pretty posies
from the "you" i love,
both of us to talk together
under stars above.
a whisper sweet discloses
the magic that you feel,
i'm delighted with the roses,
roses tell me love is real.
we sing a song of rainbows
to the tune of a lullaby,
you and i both wearing halos
so in love ~ as time goes by.
as a year begins
sweet smiles told no lie
as we gazed eye to eye,
and i fell in his arms
at a new year revelry.
a floral arrangement
a ring for engagement
the joyous bells echoed
their message to me.
guarding me, guiding me,
he gave all his love to me;
i felt so safe in his hands,
we made wedding plans.
our love stayed alive,
as past years hurried by,
still we'd gaze eye to eye
how golden the memory
sheer magic it weaves,
and as a new year begins
"i still hear violins".
i have fallen somewhere in your life,
did i trip, did i stumble or did i jump?
does it matter as long as i am here?
i have fallen somewhere in your heart,
through a crack in that armor you wear so well,
but does it really matter as long as i am here now?
i realize that my place here is precarious at best,
but i will do what i can to remain balanced,
every time you call i'm filled with joy
for it's one more time i get to hear your sweet voice.
i love to hear your laugh.
i swear i can see it through the phone.
it's what brightens my life
from dusk ti'l dawn and morning ti'l night.
as night starts to set
butterflies crawl in my stomach and never seem to go away.
then comes this awkward silence that so many like to break.
but this kind is different.
it's the kind of silence that you don't mind having around
the kind that lets you know
the person you love is just on the other side
saying without words, i love you.
back to your heart
my heart is but a mere vessel,
tossing about helplessly
in this sea of loneliness.
i long for the winds of your love
to guide me back to the shore,
back to your heart.
beating of hearts
.thump thump, thump thump .
one heart alone, makes but a single beat
a sound so low and incomplete
a heart all alone, waiting to be heard
knows not the beauty or songs of singing birds
one heart all alone, knows not love or tenderness
it feels nothing, but has emptiness
a heart alone, searches for its mate
it waits, trust fate, contemplates
until by chance another beat it hears
that sound it has longed for all these years
like the timbre of a bass drum
it hears an answer, another thrum
two hearts are beating, strong and true
the sound grows louder, waiting is through
two hearts are beating, within one another
searching is over, they have found that lover
two hearts are beating, they grow and grow
together forever, never wanting to go
two hearts are beating, as the sun goes down
a love true, a love strong, both are bound
and as the sound gently fades into night
two hearts are beating, this they know is just right
thump thump, thump thump ...
because of you
because of you
because of you
my world is now whole,
because of you
love lives in my soul.
because of you
i have laughter in my eyes,
because of you
i am no longer afraid of good-byes.
you are my pillar
my stone of strength,
with me through all seasons
and great times of length.
my love for you is pure
boundless through space and time,
it grows stronger everyday
knowing that you'll always be mine.
at the altar
i will joyously say 'i do',
for i have it all now
and it's all because of you.
behind the cloak
hiding below the surface of reality
have found refugee in the hands of fantasy
illusion is what lies ahead
stimulating my crazy head
the clock tic tacs as the time passes away
all i can think is you in my memory
believe in your heart
believe in your heart that
something wonderful is about to happen.
love your life.
believe in your own powers,
and your own potential,
and in your own innate goodness.
wake every morning
with the awe of just being alive.
discover each day the magnificent,
awesome beauty in the world.
explore and embrace life in yourself
and in everyone you see each day.
reach within to find your own specialness.
amaze yourself and rouse those around you
to the potential of each new day.
don't be afraid to admit
that you are less than perfect;
this is the essence of your humanity.
let those who love you help you.
trust enough to be able to take.
look with hope to the horizon of today,
for today is all we truly have.
live this day well.
let a little sun out as well as in.
create your own rainbows.
be open to all your possibilities;
all possibilities and miracles.
always believe in miracles.
believe me, if all those endearing young charms
believe me, if all those endearing young charms,
which i gaze on so fondly to-day
were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms,
like fairy-gifts fading away,
thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,
let thy loveliness fade as it will,
and around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
would entwine itself verdantly still.
it is not while beauty and youth are thine own,
and they cheeks unprofaned by a tear,
that the fervor and faith of a soul can be known,
to which time will but make thee more dear;
no, the heart that has truly loved never forgets,
but as truly loves on to the close,
as the sun-flower turns on her god, when he sets,
the same look which she turned when he rose.
born at last
i am your journey's end,
my name is "destiny fulfilled"
you are the fyre that ignites my own
a love, a passion so deeply thrilled.
come to me... let me reach out
and touch your flesh, so hot
you are my lust, my love;
feast on me- in you i am caught.
whirling winds of passion flow,
between our worlds that are apart,
i travel in the mists of tyme...
to hold your mind and heart.
my blood is mingled in your veins,
of me you can never be free,
colours burst behind closed eyes,
for only your soul to see.
your voice whispers to me,
in dreams you come and take all-
from my very life you feed
o how i heed your call.
you carry me to a bed of roses,
removing all the thorns,
and i will forever belong to you,
in this love, i am born.
i love you more than life itself
but, tell me ...
i don't know how many sweet words i have conjured into your mind,
but, tell me, do you remember them all?
relentless of what you do everyday.
do all the words remain intact within your mind?
does it please you when you are unpleased?
and does it intrigue you when you are unreleaved?
i don't know how many words i have conspired within a given line,
but, tell me, have you learned them all?
regardless of what is written,
do all the words rhyme within the given line?
does it inform you when you are uninformed?
and does it excite you when you are forlorned?
i don't know how many words
i have said that i can say is mine,
but, tell me, have you heard them all?
needless of all that have been said,
do all the words i bestow upon you signal some sort of sign?
does it merry you when you are sad?
and does it lecture you when you are bad?
i don't know about others but i think we are just fine,
but, tell me, have you told them all?
heedless of what we do,
do you know that i am happy just because you are my valentine?
does it delight you that i belong to only you?
and does it move you that my love for you is forever true?
suddenly i get this feeling
my mind draws a blank
my hands are slightly shaking
my heart begins to race
i feel like i'm losing control
i'm nervous inside and out
i have an unexplainable feeling
i wish i could figure this out
these butterflies inside of me
keep fluttering all throughout
i thought they were gone for good
i didn't know they could come out
it must be the way
you get to me like you do
the way you make me feel
the way i love you like i do...
can you solve for me a mystery
of why things have to change
why is life so complicated
why can't things stay the same
i understand that people grow
and often grow apart
but why did it have to be you
when i had given you my heart
i held inside my feelings
never told you how i feel
but i need to tell you somehow
that i know this could be real
you have a special something
i just can't figure out
but i know that it could work
that's what love's about
i'll keep inside my feelings
i just can't let you know
because of what will happen
you'll change and then you'll go.
clouds of love
on the night i met you,
my heart stoped beating
it froze with with desire,
at what i was seeing.
on this night for us
that shoud'nt have been,
what lay ahead nobody could see.
you alone started these flames
of wanting desire,
a million seas couldn't quench the fire.
but love isn't always the easy friend,
you have to sail the storm
to recieve the love you send.
so till the day comes
that these arms can hold you near,
i'll sail the storms and watch
as the clouds disapear.
colour of a butterfly
your butterfly has truly emerged.
bright, beautiful, symmetrical.
blazing with colour.
pinks for our love.
deep reds for our hearts,
our passions, our lips.
yellows for our glow, our light,
our spirits, our beautiful sun.
blues for our clear skies,
our peace, our calm, your eyes.
greens for our earth, our plants,
our nature that surrounds
our beautiful little bridge
that you built.
with hearts bonded and melted,
with pure love and sexiness,
with sheer poetry and excitement
come fly with me.
comfort of your love
you buried my shame in the depth of the sea
and cast my fears to the bed of the ocean.
you carried my hopes to the end of the earth
and enriched my pride with the fruits of love.
as far as the east is from the west,
you removed past guilt from my mind.
as far as the heaven is from the earth,
you sever shame from the contents of my thoughts.
as you build up my faith, mountain high,
you deeply warm my heart with a wondrous smile.
and now, being crowned in the comfort of your love,
you make me rollick in the safety of your arms.
could it be?
could it be that i once saw you
in a dream as old as time
and could it be the arms holding you
were really mine the whole time?
could you have been my one and only
the reason i woke each new day
the one thing i always needed
the one for whom i use to pray?
could it be that i had found you
after looking my entire life
could it be that i had promised
that one day i'd be your wife?
could it be that i still love you
and once again i'll find
that you're not just a memory
only to be viewed in my mind?
could it be, oh lord i pray,
just one thing i ask of you
if you're out there waiting
you'll try to find me too?
count the ways
count the ways
the endless hours and the days
my heart will pain and ache for you
my tears ran like autumn rain
when cupids love was slain
in my heart there was only pain
i turn my back upon the world.
my world was shattered
when i lost all that mattered
and my dreams were scattered
i turn my back upon the world.
my heart has been broken
her love for me was only token
all her promises now forsaken
i turn my back upon the world.
the loss of my hearts desire
cold embers where once was fire
to love again i can only aspire
i turn my back upon the world.
but with head high i went forward
feeling not a little awkward
and i found my just reward
when i went again into the world.
though my love ended in tears
it's never as dark as it appears
i've put aside my darkest fears
and i must go again out into the world.
now back from the brink of madness
with only distant memories of sadness
my heart no resounds in gladness
now i'm back again into the world.
send this poem to a friend
dance with me tonight
i want to dance with you for a life time
hold you close to my heart,
stop the hands of time
make the world give us a little more time.
to feel our bodies close swaying together
to music that only we can hear,
letting it sweep us into heaven
come, dance with me there.
we'll dance forever; never let go
hearts in tune hand to hand,
building love between us
that we barely can stand.
candles low no bright lights
our love will light the way,
come hold me close; dance with me
til the night breaks to day.
feel our bodies pressed close
as close as skin to skin,
open your heart to me baby
come on, let me in
fill my senses with your rush
let me taste your deep kiss,
hold me tightly to your heart.
never have i felt like this
never will i feel it again
for within your arms i've died,
i've gone to heaven in your love
these are happy tears i've cried.
never have i been so loved
or felt so much love for anyone,
dance with me honey
until the night is done.
dance with me until the world is done
i can't resist your charms,
dance with me and hold me close
let me die within your arms.
don't ever let me go
dancing with you is so right,
i will never let you go
come .... dance with me tonight.
as into your eyes i longingly gaze,
like looking into the stars above,
such dazzling beauty does ever amaze,
the stars, they dance, cause i'm in love.
as onto your sweet lips i gently kiss thee,
tasting a fruit that seems forbidden,
you unleash bonds that set me free,
awaken emotions that long were hidden.
and as into your bosom i find rest,
a sanctuary for my tumultuous soul,
i certainly count myself among the blessed,
to have found the one that makes me whole.
and throughout this universe i dare to say,
there is not another that could my heart so sway.
love poems index
days without you
i miss you so much day and night
i can't realise why you're gone
i just think i treat you right
but now i'm again alone
the days without you are so long
these days - without your kiss and smile
and i don't know what i've done wrong
i've been thinking of this for a while
a few questions that i need to know -
why does my heart feel so bad ?
why you could ever hurt me so ?
why can't i get you out of my head ?....
now i'm standing here alone
with this weight upon my heart
wondering why you're gone
remembering our feelings from the start
in my mind i have all my memories in a range -
each moment spent with you
but i can't realise what made you change
for me this is just un-get-able
i know i won't pull trough without you by my side
so baby come to me - don't run and hide
the only thing i want is to be with you
please honey - make my wish come true
don't you know that you make my days count?
and i'm always happy when you're around
it doesn't matter what we do
as long as i'm here with you.
as the sun rises in the east
so the breaking dawn of my love begins
as the sun sets in the west
i am overwhelmed with a burning desire
a desire locked down deep inside
one that cannot be concealed anymore
i long for one sweet kiss to quench my thirst
i long for one tender touch that will last a lifetime
at the end of it all you are my deepest desire!
i love you not today nor tomorrow but forever!
love poems index
deep eyes, deep love
eyes of passion,
blue and tender,
a world of love awaits,
a soulmate inside,
love is strong tonight,
love is uniting,
passion burns brightly,
bodies engage slightly,
eyes meet and flutter,
lips touch and quiver,
voices play together,
become one forever,
stare in her eyes,
see the sky,
for love burns brightly.
love poems index
desires of you
spoken words alone cannot express,
the love i have for you.
the written art of love is what convinces
myself, that you are the one for me.
as i gaze into your eyes
with every movement of your listless ways,
the grasping of your hand,
the warmth of your heart
i believe that you can make me feel like no other.
once i believed that love was only a fable,
configured in the mind, planted by others.
then there was you.
like a flower in bloom, wow, what a dream come true!
there are times we you make me happy,
there are times when you make me blue,
but what is even worse, is when
i don't get to see you...
do you believe ?
look into your heart and tell me what you see.
am i still on your mind; are you thinking of me?
do you wake in the night and let out a sigh?
do you whisper my name and wonder why;
i can't be there with you tonight?
with you in my arms, holding you tight?
do you believe in the miracle of love
do you believe in you
do you believe in love
do you believe it could happen to you
take me in your arms, don't ever leave
with you in my arms, i'll make you believe!
i believe in love, always and forever.
i believe in us, you and i together.
i can't believe love is pain,
you have everything to lose and nothing to gain.
tell me you believe and look into my eyes...
do you believe... i'm not like the other guys?
hold on tight, for i've given you my heart;
heart and soul from the very start.
for your love, i'll wait forever
with all my heart, i believe we'll be together.
tell me you believe love is bliss,
that you can believe in the magic of our first kiss.
answer me one question, now, before i leave...
tell me, do you believe?
what would i do if you leave?
i'd miss you, i believe
that's what i'd do if you leave
emotions are kept under my sleeve
so my prayers to you i'd give
please stay a bit longer
for i may see you again never
and you leaving isn't for the better
surely i'd miss you sooner or later
everyday i miss you more and more
it makes my heart feel so sore
thinking of the way things were,
i'd like to go back
to the times we had before.
i wish i could describe you
you're nothing but a dream
leaving me nothing to hold onto
i feel like i could scream
i would sleep forever
just to dream you again
oh, can't you come to me
to free me of this pain?
i'm lying on my bed again
waiting to fall asleep
to spend another night with you
to explore this ocean deep
i'm back in our world, i'm happy again
i see you there, and you whisk me away
and then like a bird, the time flies by
the morning arrives, much to my dismay
i cry out loud as you fade away
begging desperately for the night to stay
my eyes open, and i close them again
hoping to see your face for once, but nay
again, left with nothing but the thought
that if i were to die and go to the heaven
i'd beg to live a night with you instead
after that, i'd never think of you in vain
if only i could see your face for once
if only i could feel your touch
i'd tell you how much i love you
is that really asking for too much?
i gaze at your pictures
as i go to sleep,
i can hear your voice
it sounds oh so sweet
i then close my eyes
and sleep the night through,
the dreams that i have
are of me and you.
i awake in the morning
i know this is real,
this dream that i'm in
it feels so surreal.
i whisper your name
and say i love you,
i tell you my dreams
they're of me and you.
you look in my eyes
and hold me so tight,
the fears that we have
will soon have respite.
i cannot contain
my feelings for you,
my heart is set free
it belongs only to you.
to dream of love is to let our desires free, to let them live in a safe and wonderful land of fantasy yet hope of reality. - gabor timis
lazy summers, cold winter nights
are always alright, since i have you holding me tight.
i see that sparkle in your eyes,
through the dimness of the candlelight
you smile at me, then teasingly back your eyes.
we laugh, then you give me the sign,
and sip what's left of the wine,
your lips now meet mine, your sweet taste gets me every time.
we sit by the fire,
i see and feel the love in your eyes
our desire grows higher, then our bodys entwine
for the first time.
it isn't a game and true love is the name.
it's an everlasting love we endure
a love, so clean and so pure.
a love so deep yet unseen.
i wake up with tears in my eyes
once again... it was just a dream,
a cold winter night,
i spend once again...
send this poem to a friend
so gently they came out
almost a whisper of a sound
they mingled with the stillness
and a feeling so profound.
i first heard those words
such a long time ago
but now my world has smiled
my face began to glow.
i longed to hear those words again
bringing the winds of change
i no longer felt i had to abstain
from feeling joy instead of pain.
i said those words first
so soft yet so sweet
magically and lovingly
our eyes would meet.
her reply came next
forever to endear
as those wonderful words
now flowed into my ears.
"i love you!" i said,
and my words echoed back
from my lover's lips they came
precise and intact.
my spirit soon stirred
my soul was renewed
my heart beat loudly
as my thoughts flew.
over hills and valleys
through time and space
i kissed her sweet lips
gently caressing her face.
my tears flowed freely
gentle tracks down my cheeks
overwhelmed by my silence
i was unable to speak.
always and forever are
these moments with you
they will be like a dream
that somehow came true.
dreams of love
dreams take me to another place and time
when my life had reason and rhyme.
i was so happy and in love...
god sent me a gentle 'dove'
he loved me so, more than anyone
i will ever again know.
the talks we had while lying in bed...
he gently caressed my face and head.
i could 'feel' the love without
a word being said...
i miss those times, those precious days
but no one can take the memories away
'my angel' he will always be...
from now until eternity...
dreams of you
we stood beside the daffodils
the evening sun shone o'er the bay;
we saw the river from the hills
the hours gently passed away.
i was your girl, you were my boy
in days when life was full of joy.
and even now, i reminisce
still see the sunset o'er the bay
and feel the magic of your kiss -
the years withering away!
i'm still your girl, you're my boy,
dreams of you are dreams of joy.
also see: dreaming
some say dreams are what they are
emotions take both near and far
they say the heart is a burning place
like love knows many ways
dreams can hold the truth inside
hint you what good things you hide
yet dreams are what they are
a truth as eternal as a single star
yet i found love through my dreams
to me they were true so it seems
because i believed more than the screams
dreamtime love, love is reality
my sweet one, you are my love to me
i love you, more than as a sweet memory.
send this poem to a friend
i see ribbons of ecstacy
when you're sleeping.
you seduce me in slumber
as you dream beautiful dreams.
currents of adoration surge through me
as i watch you breathe in peace,
and i synchronize my breaths with yours
in my own awakened dream.
i want to rest with you,
but i am too busy gazing at you
with the deepest of loves.
i bend forward, touch my lips to yours
with the softest of kisses
in the most fantastical fashion.
as i arise you smile as though
it were only a part of your dream.
i watch you rest some more,
until i sit beside you
and hold your gentle hands.
then i lie beside you
and wrap your warm, relaxed body
in my arms and i close my eyes,
waiting to dream with you.
dreaming of you
when i close my eyes i dream of you.
can't sleep at night 'cause i wanna be with you.
don't want to live, don't want to cry
without you by my side.
when i go to sleep at night
i ask god to make my days bright.
i know he will do it - i know it is true.
because he knows i only want to be with you.
i hear your voice inside my head.
i can imagine us together again.
i know it will happen - i know it is true;
because i asked god if i can be with you.
i see you and i together again;
holding hands and feeling the pain.
what a beautiful feeling - i wish it were true.
but i am only dreaming - dreaming of you.

some say dreams are what they are
emotions take both near and far
they say the heart is a burning place
like love knows many ways
dreams can hold the truth inside
hint you what good things you hide
yet dreams are what they are
a truth as eternal as a single star
yet i found love through my dreams
to me they were true so it seems
because i believed more than the screams
dreamtime love, love is reality
my sweet one, you are my love to me
i love you, more than as a sweet memory.
each and every day is a bonus
each and everyday is a bonus -
whether it be for one moment,
one day or a million moments.
being with you makes me
feel new and bright.
being able to be just us.
with you we both create
a wealth of warmth
rising from our hearts.
a happy atmosphere of love.
each and everyday is a bonus.
i feel lucky and alive.
you fill me with youth
and masses and masses of
tender loving care.
i treasure every moment with you.
thank you for coming into my life.
watching you smile, my heart drops
hitting the bottom, decaying its prop
gazing into your eyes, the endless abyss
all flaws invisible, intentionally missed.
fludders from my heart lift it back up
locked into place, stuck in a rut
a nervous wreck, not really sure why
wanting your smile, i continue to try.
feelings i thought lost, found once more
your love surrounds me, stupendous galore
without my presence, but never alone
needing your voice, but not through a phone.
i have a picture of you, scorched in my mine
lost in the wilderness, only for you to find
a compass with no absolute direction
i look in the mirror to see your reflection.
winds blow with the whisper of your name
nothing in life will ever be the same
chiseled from the core, out to the skin
everything i want to say seems too thin.
adequately, i explain my feelings
on and throughout, i continue kneeling
i look in your eyes for the last time
everything about you, i want to call mine.
i want you to love me, give me a test
tell me what you want and i'll do my best
i want your trust, without a doubt
i've thought of you more times than i can count.
tell me you love me, tell me you'll stay
i promise you i'll brighten my gray
put your lips close to mine, take a deep breath
now close your eyes and i'll do the rest.
i wonder if i dreamed of you-
if you would appear?
to make my nights full of love,
and always hold me near.
i wonder if i thought of you-
if you would feel it in your soul?
like two spirits in the universe,
who always seem to know.
even if the stars went black
and the sun were to shine no more.
they could find their way to each other,
no matter how far the shore.
safely in each other's arms,
to bid the rest of time.
finding eternal love
so many seek to find.
caring for each other
through the worst of storms.
leaning on the arms of love
and never need anymore.
this is how i feel for you,
i've known it all along.
you are my one true love
my world.. my heart.. my soul!
her loveliness fills his waking hours,
and her tender arms haunt his troubled dreams.
her voice is a fountain of the sweetest waters,
and her breath, the kiss of angels.
the tone of her skin, the scent of her hair,
the color of her lips in a brightly lit room,
and the softness of her careless touch,
all are memories etched into his soul.
his longing heart races at the sound of her name,
and his emptiness is complete without her.
he counts the minutes until their hearts are one,
and each minute lost is his eternal regret.
softly whisper your passion
come to me my loving heart
i'll cherish your gentle tenderness
from this day forward i'll impart
my emotion of contentment
that grew instantly as we met
from the depth of my souls embrace
straight to you for whom it was meant
refresh your souls thirsting need
come bathe in passion's bright glowing fire
as we dance the dance of eternal love
wrapped in our flowing desires
our need for each other so great
a timeless burning flame
as at last we have found each other
and our place together we claim.
was pure destiny,
you and i
were ment to be.
maybe not now
but someday soon,
we'll meet not under the sun
but beneath the moon.
we'll watch the stars
'till they fade away,
but we won't fade
together we'll always stay.
this is the day
i'm waiting for,
from that day
i'll love you more and more.
i can't wait to watch
the sun set with you,
every sunset from that day
'till the rest of
our lives are through.
you are everything i'll ever need
to make my life complete.
since you came into my life
my every dream has come true.
i'll never love anyone
as much as i love you.
you are the light when there's darkness
shining brightly through your eyes.
yours are the arms i want to hold me
through all of my nights.
my heart belongs to you only
the one true love in my life.
our souls are intertwined
to always be like one.
may your every need be fulfilled
without ever a question.
may every sadness you have ever felt
turn into a smile.
unselfishly i give myself to you
never with hesitation
because you and only you
for always will be,
my partner, my lover, my friend
feel the love without ever a doubt
it is yours for a lifetime.
every time i see you,
i want you more and more.
every time you say, "hi" to me,
my heart begins to soar.
every time you touch me,
i pinch myself to see if i'm awake.
every time you look into my eyes,
it's my heart you begin to take.
every time i see you smile,
i wish that it was at me.
every time i hear your voice
i regret that 'we' just could not be.
for the truth is... she likes you
so, i must take a seat.
for she has feelings deeper
than mine could never beat.
for since we are good friends,
i could never take you away.
so, i will look at you with a tear in my eye
hoping for the day...
when i can hold you by my side,
and my deepest feelings
i won't have to hide.
even if it takes forever to see
what happiness really means to me
i understand love will always be
in perfect harmony
between you and me
one day you will come to know
that no matter how far you may go
the joys and sorrows that we share
are just like the touch of your hair
which is full of tender care
yet i can only say
this love for you will never decay
i love you every single day
and in every sinle way
and it pains me to see you fading away.
i didn't know i could love
anyone as much as i love you
for the sound of your voice,
makes all my dreams come true.
you walk into a room, and
i know you have arrived;
my heart skips a beat when
you walk up to my side.
i hope this kind of magic stays
forever between us two,
and the whole wide world will
know that god sent me you.
field of love
holding you so close, in a field of magic love
your eyes are shining brighter than the starlit sky above
the flowers that bloom 'round us, they tickle at our feet
the river sleeps behind us, the silence is so sweet.
the wind blows just so slightly, to tell us that it's there,
and to blow the windswept petals, that lovedance in the air.
the passion that is bred here is as old as god above,
but the only way to feel it, is to bring the one you love.
and even though this magic field is natures' greatest feat,
without you here beside me... the magic's incomplete.
you leaned over and you kissed me
i felt my knees go weak
you leaned over and you kissed me
i couldn't even speak
you leaned over and you kissed me
with a passion flowing free
you leaned over and you kissed me
sparks flew that we could see
you leaned over and you kissed me
a touch so soft and tender
you leaned over and you kissed me
a kiss i would remember
you leaned over and you kissed me
i'm sure i kissed you back
you leaned over and you kissed me
with the fire no kiss should lack
you leaned over and you kissed me
you left me wanting more
you leaned over and you kissed me
my soul you did explore
you leaned over and you kissed me
my heart no longer full of pain
you leaned over and you kissed me
darling, kiss me once again
love poems index
your lips speak soft sweetness
your touch a cool caress
i am lost in your magic
my heart beats within your chest.
..i think of you each morning
and dream of you each night
i think of your arms being around me
and cannot express my delight.
never have i fallen
but i am quickly on my way
you hold a heart in your hands
that has never before been given away.
short love poems
most romantic movies
it was late sunday night when we said good-bye
i knew right then that my heart would cry...
you felt so cold, and it hurt me so...
i loved you so much, that i let you go...
a love so true, it felt so sweet...
for a year of my life, you swept me off my feet...
i tried everyday, to remind you of my love...
for i knew you were precious and sent from up above...
i held you every moment... i held you tight...
praying you would always love me every day, and every night
but time went on, as it tends to do...
and with times passing, i fell even deeper for you...
your love grew tiresome... it tore me apart...
and you broke every promise, when you broke my heart...
flames of passion
what is this, if not passion
the feeling of something unusual
waiting to be caressed, wanting to explode,
what if i get that heavenly touch
for which my body has been aching
will i remain what i am
or will the entwining of the bodies
lead me to something ethereal
i am confused, do not know how to react
but what i know is that i yearn for that touch
a soothing touch of caress
and a wild sensation of fulfillment.
the language of true love is forever
that's why love goes away never
love comes to me in the form of someone like you
and in my heart i know what i feel is true
i would give up everything to spend forever with you
for forever is worth leaving behind everything i have and do
sad to say, forever is not meant for you and me
i could never have your heart for free
you're out of reach and i'm very far behind
to dream of you and me forever, i must be out of my mind
but i'd give up forever to have you now
one moment in time is enough for me to spend with you somehow
for this much is true and this much i know
a single moment of true joy is more powerful than a lifetime of sorrow
how i'd love to have you forever, but what's forever for
tomorrow might not come anymore.
forever takes me by a minute,
forever and always
it started out simple
like somthing new
i knew from the beginning
there was just somthing about you.
i loved the way you smiled
and the way you laughed
we were on different roads
until the roads came to one path.
when you asked me out
the butterflies came
they came in my heart
and i was never the same.
we became one
at the same time we were best friends
you said "forever and always"
and i thought it would never end.
it was like that for a while
and i lived for your kiss
you told me i was beautiful
and i felt such total bliss.
but one night, your mind changed
and you turned it all around
you brought me up so high
just to tear me back down.
after that it was never the same
and i cried for all those days
now i think i finally realize
forever doesn't mean for always.
i never asked
for a blessing like you.
like i've spoken to god
and my wishes came true.
i asked for a person
to love and to hold.
to be loyal and faithful
not angry and cold.
god placed you on earth
as i quested to find,
the one who would be there
so sweet and so kind.
in my wildest dreams
i would have denied.
that something so perfect
could at all be supplied.
you have such a sweet face
but you are so much more.
you're my friend and i love you.
your flaws i ignore.
with this small, simple statement
i give you and pray,
that you'll love me forever,
and forever you'll stay.
forever my love will be
when troubles bring you down
and you don't know what to do,
just look inside your heart
and you'll know that i love you.
every one has a destiny to find,
looking in your eyes i have found mine.
you're all i ever wanted,
you're all i'll ever need.
i will be yours always,
you will have my love for eternity.
forever the bonds
whenever you are down
remember i am here
hoping to lift spirits
with loving cheer
in the good times or bad
love always remains
with forever bonds
my heart contains
here if ever you need me
i want to let you know
seeds of friendship
continue to grow
its the bright rays of hope
you shall come to see
nothing will replace
promises are guaranteed
no matter how far apart
i will keep you always
close to my heart.
i love you more than words could ever say,
i feel it growing in my heart each and every day,
all this love i feel
has never felt so real
you give me something no one has ever given me,
it's something you cannot see
love so strong, and so true
it makes me think of only you
this wonderful feeling you have given me
makes me want to be with you endlessly.
i want to be in your arms
to feel your warm embrace
it makes me feel so safe from harm
plus, i love to touch your face
i love to look into your eyes
to look through your disguise
to feel your warm hands within mine
as our fingers gently become entwined.
your kisses so soft and sweet
it makes me crave a thousand more
i wonder how your heart keeps a steady beat,
because mine just soars.
i love the way you let me know
how much you love me so
i love how much you care
the love you show to me is beyond compare,
i love the way you smile
that compliments your sexy style
my eyes are kept on you all the while.
i love to hear you say "okay"
you say it at least once a day
i love the way you apologize
because it always makes me realize
that what you did, was done unintentionally,
and that you still love me
even though i'm strange
you don't want me to change
you say that i'm just right
especially when we're about to fight.
i hate to see you mad
i hate to see you sad
it makes me feel so bad
what you feel, i feel
that's because our love is real
i hate to see you cry
to always have to wonder why?
i'm sorry i sometimes do the things i do
that always make you feel blue
i'm sorry if i hurt you so
my anger is sometimes hard to control.
i don't like when you feel insecure
don't worry so much, because i'm sure
that no one can ever take your place
because i love not only your beautiful face,
i also love the real you inside
there's no way i could have let you pass me by.
don't worry you're the only one for me
you, and i, and everyone else can see
i love you with all my heart
no one could ever make us part.
from now and forever
"goodbye my dear one,
i sing you this song,
deep in my poor heart,
your memory lives on."
how saddened was i
that the love in your eye,
fell on another heart
no wonder i cry.
and how dejected was i
to see you flit by
caressing a new love
prettier than i.
but maybe tomorrow,
i hope i will see
she is your past love
and then it will be:
"hello my dearest,
i sing you this song,
from now and forever,
our love will go on."
give me your word
give me your word
our love will never die.
give me your word
you feel the same as i.
my heart will beat a lifetime, just for you
outshine the moon
your radiance lends warmth
to the sun, at high noon
you are beautiful -
like a portrait, framed in gold
in comparison to you
even fire seems cold.
show me some sign
that i have touched your heart
like the way you have mine
you are wonderful -
like a june moonlit night
like that last puzzle piece
when it fits in just right.
what more can i say
my thoughts are all of you
every night, every day
you have touched -
something brand new in me
and these things i now feel
i feel, so tenderly.
god is our shepherd, my love
fly beyond the skies with me,
our fantasy of love to be;
never-ending, hearts ascending,
flying high and free.
over clouds, over the sea,
sailing to heaven above,
in the springtime,
we will fly on wings of a dove,
god is our shepherd -
this is our song!
god is our shepherd, my love.
have you ever
have you ever been around someone
and just couldn't think?
have you ever been around someone
lips, soft as a rose's pink?
have you ever been around someone
heart as vast as the open sea?
have you ever been around someone
together forever you wish to be?
have you ever been around someone
into their eyes you gaze?
have you ever been around someone
piercing the soul like the sun's rays?
have you ever been around someone
and chose to run and hide?
have you ever been around someone
scared of what feelins are inside?
have you ever .........
you stole my heart unexpectedly,
yet you held it oh, so dear.
you showed me how to love again,
as you chased away my fear.
you drowned me with your passion
and you showered me with your kiss.
you gave me love and affection
as i lingered in this bliss.
i never thought i'd love again
but i know now my heart has healed.
since the day i met you,
i knew my fate was sealed.
how have i been so lucky
to have met someone like you?
i may never know the answer,
but i thank god...
because you're a dream come true.
heart of gold
the happiest day of my life
was the day that i met you
always loving and understanding
with a heart of gold too
you'd always show how much you care
with the loving things you do
from a tender kiss to a warm
embrace and whisper "i love you"
we've had a lot of happy times
and also had some tears
but our love for each other
still remained strong,
throughout the years
all goods things have to
come to an end it's sad i know
but true though in my heart
i know that i will always love you
and your heart of gold.
heart to heart
sometimes in this lifetime,
we meet a special soul,
who fills our very essence,
to almost overflow,
we drink the cup of friendship,
it tastes like ruby wine,
and you know within your heart,
this meeting was divine.
this soul that lives within your heart,
no distance can prevail,
an inner spark, within the heart,
becomes a holy grail,
the starting of a journey,
in which you both shall be,
a reflection of each other,
for all eternity.
brandish you, my hearts delight
i yield to you every night
and in the time i've spent alone
my love for you i've always known.
passion burns in lovers eyes
one look from you, my spirits rise
this flame inside, still burns bright
and from my soul, this light takes flight.
lately this rain seems less dreary
because of this, my hearts less weary
and if in fact we're meant to be
the sky will clear so i may see.
a future bright and filled with love
sends cleansing rain from above
to wash away the painful tears
and release my heart of once felt fears.
each time i look at you my dear
there seems nothing i should fear
once locked up dreams come undone
a new life for me has begun.
my life spins in tune with yours
twirling and dancing through open doors
a cycle with a touch of fate
our worlds entwined, creating hate.
through our bond, we rose to fight
a love this strong can break the night
through this fight, we mean no pain
happiness is all we wish to gain.
he touches me
he touches me in mysterious ways
only my heart can understand.
the feelings he evokes when his eyes meet mine
are almost more than i can stand.
he gently breathes, i close my eyes
and feel his love flow softly over me
like a babbling brook, winding its way
through  the  forest; an endless stream to the sea.
the stars in the sky spell out his name,
as the clouds come racing in
to hold him closer;  as if even they,
can not be without him.
he only has to speak my name
and my fragile heart skips a beat
and as his tender words are uttered,
all my doubts and troubled fears
are put to sleep.
he touches me and i'm filled
with the most warm and wondrous light
it's as if before him, i was just as dark
as the dead of the longest night.
just to gaze into his eyes
and feel his heart beat with mine,
it's all i'll ever, ever ask until the end of time!
heavenly promises on mended wings
the sweetest melodies are those sung from the heart.
the softest harmonies are when two souls mend together.
why then do people say it's love that tears them apart?
when it's with love that you can stand the stormy weather.
when i met you, spring was here, and the birds were nesting.
i looked into your soft eyes and saw the prettiest smile.
heaven pulled down her vail and offered her most sacred blessing.
i've met an angel, i couldn't help but to smile.
sittting by the pool of life, reflecting upon it's surface,
i think of others and i get a little ripple.
i think of you, and a wave swells, spraying my face.
you said you wouldn't cry, but i see the tears start to trickle.
some people don't believe in love at first sight,
obviously they haven't seen you.
drifting on love's endless blissful flight,
i'm so glad i met you.
love poems index
passion burning deep in my heart
wishing that we were never apart
coming together hand in hand
melted and pressed as grains of sand
shaping a most beautiful pane of glass
etchings abound and trimmed with brass
a beautiful display wanting all to see
remains hidden and sheltered only for me.
hope is a thing with feathers
hope is a thing with feathers
that perches in the soul
and sings a tune without words
and never stops at all.
and sweetest, in the gale, is heard
and sore must be the storm
that could abash the little bird
that keeps so many warm.
i've heard it in the chilliest land
and on the strangest sea
yet, never, in extremity
it ask a crumb of me.
how do i love thee ?
how do i love thee? let me count the ways.
i love thee to the depth and breadth and height
my soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
for the ends of being and ideal grace.
i love thee to the level of everyday's
most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
i love thee freely, as men strive for right;
i love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
i love thee with the passion put to use
in my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose
with my lost saints,--i love thee with the breath,
smiles, tears, of all my life!--and, if god choose,
i shall but love thee better after death.
how to kiss
how would i kiss you?
let me describe the ways -
i would hold your gaze with mine
as i approach the corner of your mouth,
then softly kiss you there.
i would kiss your eyes, one by one,
with my fingers tease your chest
and press closer into your warmth
i would inhale the scent of your hair,
drawing a draught of you deeply
into my being, into my heart.
i would move to your ear and linger...
whispering your name with
the warmth of my breath,
then softly kiss you there.
i would kiss, lightly as a hush,
your cheek, then very slowly
returning to your mouth, pause,
then brush it with my burning lips.
then softly i would kiss you there,
press you closer into my warmth
into my being, into my heart
and savour the aching anticipation
that wells in throbs within,
the want of more of you...
how you make me feel
when i am wrapped up in your arms,
i feel safer than ever before.
when you stare into my eyes, its a feeling i can't ignore.
i know this isn't just a game,
because, what i feel for you,
i never felt with anyone else.
when i am close to you i am overwhelmed with happiness.
you're what i've been waiting for my whole life.
you're someone i can share my love with,
you take away my fears.
words can't express how much i love you.
but, through this short amount of time,
i hope you realize that my love for you is real.
i'm not with you to play games,
and i know you feel the same.
with you, is where i want to be
because i found someone who loves me just for me.
you give me all the reason in the world
to believe that you won't hurt me in anyway.
and if i ever lost you,
i don't know what i would do.
you probably think i am crazy,
but truthfully i'm not.
every time that were together,
it's a whole new experience for me.
all i see in this world,
is no one else but you and me.
i'm missing you
why can't i speak when i have so much to tell?
why can't i write when i have so much in mind?
why can't i sing when there's music in my heart?
why can't i dance when there's rythm in the air?
too many words left unspoken
too many things left undone
why can't it be and why can't i?
for all i know this pain deep inside
took the gladness from my heart.
is this the pain of missing you?
is this the reason behind it all?
hear the agony of my heart
longing for you and for your touch
feeling your lips, feeling your face
missing your kisses and warm embrace.
when will the waiting ever be over?
for as long as were apart i can never be whole
oh! my dearest love
i just want you to know
that my heart is aching because
"i'm missing you!"
love poems index
i am not yours
i am not yours, not lost in you,
not lost, although i long to be
lost as a candle lit at noon,
lost as a snowflake in the sea.
you love me, and i find you still
a spirit beautiful and bright,
yet i am i, who long to be
lost as a light is lost in light.
oh plunge me deep in love -- put out
my senses, leave me deaf and blind,
swept by the tempest of your love,
a taper in a rushing wind.
i miss you
i count the hours,
i count the days.
how much i miss you,
i count the ways.
i miss your voice,
i miss your touch.
and i miss the face,
that i love so much.
how to describe it,
there is now way.
i walk around,
in a permanent daze.
i long to feel,
your warm embrace.
and to see a smile,
upon your face.
i will not sleep,
won't close one eye.
until you're home,
safe and alive.
while you're overseas,
and i'm safe at home.
i think of you out there,
in danger and alone.
this is the life you've chosen,
and i can't change your mind.
you've found your inner bravery,
and now i must find mine.
i miss you so much,
to the moon and the stars.
and this feeling will go on,
until you're safe in my arms.
love poems index
i can't have you
if loving you is wrong
then my heart knows not what is right
i cry myself to sleep
every second of the night
what is there to do?
what is there to say?
i know i can't have you
but still i give my heart away
i could never ask for more
gazing at the stars in a dark cold night
uttering sweet words beneath pale moonlight
i wish you can see i wish you can hear
i wish you can kiss and hold me tight
i close my eyes and shed those tears
thinking how far you are from me
then i look above and see the stars
how they light, they glitter and sparkle
despite how far they are by sight
i find myself smiling as i realize
that though distance between us
kept us apart but only in body
and never in heart
you gave me reason to smile
you gave me reason to hope
you gave me so much and
i can never ask for more
and if i have one thing to thank right now
that's when you came into my life!
as i sit here now wondering of you,
i remember the days we had,
you my darling so bright and full of life,
you made me complete so whole and so bright,
i loved the way you made me feel,
so welcome, so loved, and so special,
so in return this love i have,
i gave it to you my angel from the sky.
the way your hands would squeeze me tight
would melt my heart, yet now i cry.
for the first time ever in my life,
i found a love, a love with you,
a love that i thought would never end,
yet as we grow further apart,
it begins to destroy my broken heart.
i long to see you smile again,
i never meant to make you cry,
you were my lady one in a world,
and now i ache as i let you go.
if only i were to know,
that this moment now was going to happen.
i would change the past, the present and the future.
my love is forever with you,
but please, please, please
remember me, remember us
and please dont make me say if only i.
send this poem to a friend
if i could
if i could catch a rainbow,
i would do it just for you
and share with you it's beauty,
on the days you're feeling blue.
if i could, i'd build a mountain
you could call your very own,
a place to find serenity,
a place to be alone.
if i could take your troubles,
i would toss them in the sea,
but all these things i'm finding
are impossible for me.
i cannot build a mountain
or catch a rainbow, fair,
but let me be what i know best,
a friend that's always there,
and a love that will never disappear.
if i could turn back time
if i could be young once again
i would have sooner met you
and all that would have remained
is the love i have for you
if i could have just shown you
how much you mean to me
then i could have died happily
with the tears of joy in me
if i could have been your knight
brave and donned in shining armour
then i would have been your prince
and not as your friend anymore
if i could have been a stranger
and not as myself to you
then i might have had the courage
to say wholeheartedly i love you
if i could have lived my life
then you could have seen me through
because all that i had ever did
was for you to love me too
if i could have just seen tomorrow
i would have jumped ahead of time
because today it might have not ended
and today you might have been mine
send this poem to a friend
if i were to fall in love
if i were to fall in love,
it would have to be with you.
your eyes, your smile,
the way you laugh,
the things you say and do.
take me to the places,
my heart never knew.
so, if i were to fall in love,
it would have to be with you.
if i were to give my heart,
it would have to be to you,
for you bring things into my life,
so beautiful and new.
love, so soft and warm beside me,
i found you
you're the one i couldn't forget
even at the last breath i take
you're the one my heart longs for
because i found real joy in you
you're the one i'll love so true
for you gave me same love too
you're the one i needed most
for i am so in love with you
you light my life and turn it right
and put a music in my heart
how can i thank you for all the things
and for the love you've given me?
i can never ask for more because
my life has been complete since
i found you!
i just wanted you to know
you're the air i breath,
the scent i smell,
you're the touch i feel
you're everything that's real.
you're the better half,
the stronger willed,
you're the the beat of the heart,
the more compelled.
you're the sun that shines,
the lighter side,
you're the grass that grows,
the stream that flows.
you are the inner soul,
the eyes that shine,
the one i love,
my peace of mind.
you are and will always be
the better part of me.
if there were no tommorow
i would tell you today
that you are the one that fills my life
whose smile i cannot wait to see
whose arms i long to have wrapped around me
whose lips i live to kiss
softly, passionately, in every way.
i would want you to know
that you make my heart skip a beat
you fill my soul with contentment
you brighten my dark skies
you fill my days and nights
with stars, hopes, and cascading dreams.
i would want you to see
how beautiful the world looks with your eyes through mine
your eyes light up the sky
your touch paints the heavens
your kiss creates amazing rainbows
of beauty, sunshine, and life.
i would want you to understand
that i have always loved you
before i knew there was you
before our eyes ever met
before i found in you
happiness, completeness, and passion.
if there were no tomorrow
i would tell you
that you are the greatest gift in my life
whose love i cherish above all else
you sustain me with
your laughter, love, and friendship
before there was no knowing
i'd tell you i love you infinitely, without boundaries, and beyond time.
if once i had loved you
if once i had loved you,
and trusted you with my heart.
why did you tear it apart?
if once i had loved you,
with all my good will.
why did it all spill?
if once i had loved you,
and watched you in teh night.
why was there that fight?
but if once i hadn't loved you,
and made you my eternal life.
would i have been your wife?
and if once i hadn't loved you,
and i let my heart be free.
would you have belonged to me?
but, once i did love you,
regret that? i don't.
love you again? i won't.
if you only had a clue
you can walk past me
and you don't see a thing
i just walk by with a smile
but insidem my heart is aching
and i wanna know
if i mean something to you
i want you to feel
all my feelings that are true
i want you to see me
but what am i supposed to do
if you can't, and you won't
if you only had a clue
i walk back and forth
to see your smiling face
i see you standing there
and it's you i yearn to embrace
i can feel your heart beat
but you're so far away
one smile from you
can brighten up my day
i want you to see me
but what can i do?
if you chose not to
if you only had a clue
i love to see you smile
and i love knowing that i caused that smile
i love to see you happy
and i love knowing that i caused that happiness
i love to look into your beautiful eyes
and i love the way i fall into them
i love it when you hold my hand
and i love having the courage to grab and hold yours
i love to tease and torment you
and i love it when you tease and torment me
i love it when you touch me
and i love to touch you
i love rediscovering how beautiful you are each time i see you
and i love realizing how attractive you make me feel
i love wanting so badly to kiss you
and i love the way you want to take things slow
i love the fact that you still want to be my friend
and i love that i want to be yours
i love so many things about you
but the most important thing is:
i love you!
i love you
i never really knew you
you were just another friend
but when i got to know you,
i let my heart unbend.
i couldn't help past memories
that would only make me cry
i had to forget my first love
and give love another try
so i've fallen in love with you
and i'll never let you go
i love you more than anyone
i just had to let you know
and if you ever wonder why
i don't know what i'll say
but i'll never stop loving you
each and every day
my feelings for you will never change
just know my feelings are true
just remember one thing
i love you!
i love you with all i am
i love you with all i am
and all i'll ever be.
you are my moon, my sun and stars,
my earth, my sky, my sea.
my love for you goes down and down
beneath both life and death,
so deep it must remain when i
have drawn my last faint breath.
holding you for months and years
will make time disappear,
will make your lips my lips, your face
my face, your tear my tear;
will make us one strange personage
all intertwined in bliss,
not man or woman, live or dead--
just nothing--but a kiss!
i love you all my life
i love you all my life,
now and forever
i will always love you, and whatever
trials, i will come closer
i will always be faithful and true to you
you have given me hope, made me
stronger in times when i am blue
the hope which i thought was
really hard to find
just came along the way, just
at the right time
the time in which no more tears
left to cry
your hugs of comfort ease my pain,
now, there's no need to cry
i am amazed of how you filled my
heart with so much love
you treat me like a princess, so glad
how you raise me up above
you have been pouring out so much
love from your heart my dear
and all my life i will serve and love you
and for you, all trials i'll bear.
i love you, all of you!
i love your soft kisses.
i love your soft touch.
i love the way you bite your lip.
i love you soooooo much.
i love the way you look at me.
i love the way you smile.
i love the way you're shy sometimes,
every once and a while.
i love it when you look at me,
when i'm not looking at you.
you think i do not realize it,
but really...i do.
i love the way you cuddle.
i love the way you sleep.
i love the way you rub your neck,
when you are thinking so deep.
i love all of you,
your nose, your lips, your hair, your feet.
i will never stop loving you.
you are so amazingly sweet.
i love that i love you.
i have loved you from the very start.
i love all of you,
i now hand you the key to my heart.
i love you even more
i promise to hold you in my heart
forever, as long as i live
never forget the way you smile
nor the love you give.
so energetic and full of life
that's how we were when we were young
we were so happy there together
laughing under the sun.
when you left i was so sad
emotions flooded my days
tears constantly pouring down
but i covered the pain in so many ways.
even now your not here
how can i bare to go on?
by remembering the promise i made
and how the distance makes our love strong.
all i do is wait for when you return
to feel your hand in mine
i will be patient
no matter how long the time.
never leave my life
or i'll be stripped to my core
because i miss you every single day
and i love you even more.
i love you, miss you, need you
i love you more than all the stars in the sky.
i love you more as each moment passes us by.
i love you more with every breath i take.
i love you more with each promise we make.
i need you like a flower needs the rain.
i need you for you can wash away my pain.
i need you more each day
i need you for you are so wonderful, in every single way.
i miss you more than ever now.
i miss you because i really need you somehow.
i miss you and your touch.
i miss you for to me, you mean so much.
i want you to caress my lips the way you always do.
i want you to look into my eyes and see my love for you.
i want you to hold me close to your heart.
i want you to know that i love you, need you, miss you, and want you
and i have for every single moment, right from the start.
i need you to need me
it wasn't love at first sight,
it came to me late at night,
when my soul was filled with life's plight,
that was when i saw your light.
i knew you were who i'd been searching for,
the reason i had stepped from the door,
you were my personal goddess to the core,
you were what i wanted/needed and more.
i wrote of my love for you,
and i went insane before it was through,
but when the time was past due,
i confessed it all in a pew.
you told me how wondrful it was,
that my love was sent form above,
more beautiful than a soaring dove,
and it fit you as a glove.
but you just didn't feel that way,
and you didn't talk to me the next day,
and in you decision i had no say,
i merely stood lonely at the bay.
i am down on my knees,
begging you to hear my plea,
hoping that you will see,
what you are doing to me.
i'd be your slave, if you so desired,
for you are the one i've always admired,
yet you threw me to the fire,
and my situation is dire.
i love you - you are my all,
but i still walk alone in life's hall,
while your shadow is cast over me tall,
and i hear my heart's call.
so, my own goddess, hear my prayer,
it may not sound fair,
but you are my one and only care,
and this pain i can no longer bare.
so come to me at night,
as did oyur light,
to end my horrible plight,
i swear to you,it will be a wonderful sight.
i never thought
i haven't known you very long
but that's not the way i feel;
i've told you all about me
i have nothing to conceal.
what i say may sound silly now
but you'll find it to be true;
i never thought that when we met
i would fall in love with you.
you are my new beginning,
you're the door to life beyond;
you're all that i could ever want
or ever need to carry on.
you're the future i have dreamed of,
you're a new and brighter day;
with you, there is no looking back,
the past can fade away.
though i haven't known you very long
you'll find all i've said is true;
i never thought that when we met
i would fall in love with you.
send this poem to a friend
in heaven's rendezvous
the musical nightingale told me
that you are thinking about me
just as i am thinking of you...
breezes thro' the trees whispered
that sometime between sunset and sunrise,
we will meet in heaven's rendezvous.
ah - and the waning moon promised
you would be there anon, holding me
tenderly - singing our love song.
i always believe the harvest moon
also the gentle nocturnal breeze.
and how could a nightingale ever lie?
so tonight will be our night of nights
with a million bright stars in the sky.
send this poem to a friend
in love once again
save me a place in your heart.
let me stay ~ never to part.
you'd be my hero,
by now you should know
that i'll save you a place
in my heart...
shall i say it over again
to the tune of a gentle refrain?
as we walk in the sun
we'll be as one,
you and i together
falling in love once again.
in my dreams
your the one in my dreams at night,
while stars shine and in my mind good things twine.
every night i wish to see you,
to hold you and feel you.
but yet these things i never show,
i just want you to know that they are there.
for you when you're in spare for love.
and so i end in my deepest reget
that i waited so long to show my love to you.
but you mean more to me than anything.
in my heart
in my heart,
i hold your love close,
it's your love that i need the most.
i sit here as i watch the sunrise
in the morning dew,
i see the tip of it looking like a flame,
as i'm feeling this burning love for you.
i sit here alone with all my thoughts of you,
watching the sunlght begin to fill the room.
thinking of our future,
and all the things that we will do,
you holding me in your arms,
your heart beating against mine,
as we get lost in time.
as i dream of that distant place,
where you will always be mine.
in my heart you will always be,
the one, the only one for me!
i don't look forward going through the day,
knowing you're not here with me.
thinking of the endless hours,
and the days dragging by.
why does it have to be this way?
i have a wish for you and me,
and i hope that the good lord grants it,
for you see,
i wish that you would bring your love to me.
in my heart,
you will never leave,
so i don't have to grieve,
in my heart,
you're my only one,
and i want you with me always,
till all our days are done.
love poems index
in search of you
at times in life, when i stop distressed,
to find my wounds, lying undressed;
and pain is all that i can feel,
with no one around, to get me to heal.
at times in life, when i do tire,
whose company do i admire?
i search  in vain, for a lap to lie,
if not that, just a shoulder to cry.
at times in life, whom do i blame?
when fate plays a nasty game.
best friends turn bitter foes,
and leave behind a string of throes.
at times in life, when everything's good,
i'm enjoying good wine and delicious food.
just when i have, forgotten to cry,
with whom do i share this ample joy?
at times in life, when i'm trudging along,
with no one to whom i can belong;
i need nothing, but love that's true,
which is why i am, in search of you!
i've captured unicorns in flight
through twilights purple skies
danced with aphrodite as
i gazed into her eyes
i've been intrigued by whispering angels
frozen by the breath of the divine
made love atop soft silver clouds
built castles from the sands of time
in a breath i've taken in the
scent of all that perfumes eden
bathed in glistening moonlight
transformed rainbows into seasons
mythic journeys through the heavens
have never taken me as high
as the magic of her presence or the
sparkle in her eyes
she is my goddess of love and beauty
she is my lord divine
enchanting as the blackest rose
yet radiant as sunshine
she has the smile of an angel
a butterflys gentle touch
ti's she who mystifies my dreams
i've come to love so much
i find myself returning to the
streams of liquid light
condemned to suffer once again
amidst that ghostly winter night
forbidden love concealed in shadows
haunting secrets unrevealed
despair and sorrow fill my eyes for
she knows not how i feel.
intermezzo of my soul
i searched for you
and i found you
intermezzo of my soul.
i build my life around you
mine, is a loving role.
i will cling to you forever
no hope without your call,
be here in winter weather
in summer and in fall.
i searched for you
and i found you, so come
now make me whole,
eager arms await you,
intermezzo of my soul.
send this poem to a friend
i promise to be your warm spot to cuddle up to
when you feel cold
i promise to be your soft place to land
if you should fall
i promise to be the first
one to say i am sorry (even if i was right)
i promise to be there for you
in all of your times of joy and sorrow
i promise to support you no matter
what your decision (even if i don't agree )
i promise to make a new memory
with you each and every day
i promise to love you without change.
i promise to make you laugh
i promise not to make you cry
i promise to give you strength when you are weak
i promise to love you forever
i promise to cherish you and your love
i promise to compromise with you
i promise to make you and our children my first priority
i promise to never take your love for granted
i promise to never lose faith in you
i promise to never give you a reason to distrust me
i promise to always trust you
i promise to work with you to resolve our conflicts
i promise to always be proud of you
i promise to never let you feel alone in this world
i promise to find new ways everyday to keep the fires of passion burning
i promise to be the best mom i can to our children
i promise to always keep you as an equal partner
i promise to never say things to you in anger
i promise to be your partner for life
i promise to be your shelter from the storm.
i promise you a love everlasting.
when i looked into your eyes
i knew it was true.
my heart never lies
i was in love with you.
as you stood there
just looking around,
my whole body melted
into the ground.
i remember the day,
i remember the time,
i remember the place,
it was always on my mind.
you looked so good
in your shirt and jeans.
i remember that night,
you were in my dreams.
i wish i could be with you
day after day,
because i love you
more than words can ever say.
it could be forever
sorry, for the way i stare
forgive me, for the way i think of you
pardon me, for dreaming all about you
and do understand, the way i love you
if you just knew what it is like this way
i'll be there
when you find yourself on your own,
remember that you are not alone,
and when your feeling down and  blue,
remember that i'll always love you.
when i am not here with you,
remember that our love is pure and true,
i think about you every night and day,
when im with you i want to stay.
i hope you will always remember me,
coz' i will remember you for eternity
i never want to let you go,
coz' i love you more than you could ever know.
if there was anything i could do,
i would do it just to please you,
you know its well and truly  true,
i would do anything for you.
when your looking at the stars,
in the eternal blue
remember that each star out there
is a reason why i love you
and when you think your alone,
and when no one is there at all
i'll be right in front of you,
to catch you when you fall .
dedicated to lily fisher
i've dreamed of loving you for many years
i've dreamed of loving you for many years,
loving you each day and night, each hour,
loving till you flow into my tears,
and i into the garden where you flower.
of course i must be me, as you are you,
but just as bushes planted side by side
so intertwine one cannot tell they're two,
we will through love and time be unified.
so have i dreamed, though we have been apart
so long that i of life with you despaired,
holding wounded hope within my heart
that through these frozen years it might be spared.
the world is a redaction of the dream.
our greatest pain deep longings shall redeem.
i've pledged you my heart
let the stars, my princess, fade and fall
i want to be with you
i sit here in the night
staring into the heavens above.
wondering if im lucky enough
to be given your love.
even though i met you
just a few days before.
i have learned so much of who you are
and thirst to learn even more.
i want to share my world with you,
all the smiles and all the tears.
i want to learn to trust again;
something i havent done in years.
you are very special to me,
you have kindled something new.
i want to feel loved in my life,
i want to be with you.
i want you to know
i want you to know...
that i love you so.
deep in my heart is where you'll stay,
each and everyday,
now, forever, and always.
i want you to know...
that i'll always be there,
to show you how much i care.
i'll never let you down
i'll do anything to keep away your frown.
i want you to know...
how much you mean to me
you're my eyes to see,
my heart to beat, and my air to breathe,
without you, there's no me.
i want you to know...
that "i love you".
i will love you forever
i love you so deeply
i love you so much,
i love the sound of your voice
and the way that we touch
i love your warm smile
and your kind, thoughtful way,
and the joy you bring to my life
each and every day
i love you today
as i have from the start,
and i'll love you forever
with all of my heart.
love poems index
i would give all i have
i would give all i have to have you with me,
to see tomorrow with you,
to touch and hold the one thing dear to me,
i would climb the highest mountains,
i would swim the widest oceans,
closed my eyes and be blinded by your love,
trusting in you to lead my way,
i would give all i had for you,
to love you and be loved in return,
to adore you, and be adored in return,
i would give my all to be with you,
to make the memories of yesterday forever,
to see me and you in the future.
i would give all i have for you,
lay down my life for you,
to sacrifice my soul for your pardon,
i would give all i have for you,
be it to travel to the ends of the earth,
to catch the falling stars out of the skies above,
i would give all,
to hear you say the words i so needed to hear,
the word that would heal my broken heart,
the words that means all the world to me,
to hear you say "i love you",
and look into your eyes knowing you meant it,
for i would give all i have in life for you,
for you gave me all i have in life,
and without you, i have nothing.
i would live in your love
i would live in your love as the sea-grasses live in the sea,
borne up by each wave as it passes, drawn down by each wave that recedes;
i would empty my soul of the dreams that have gathered in me,
i would beat with your heart as it beats, i would follow your soul as it leads.
i would still have you
you were there
you were gone so quickly
i became attached
in love.. yes, i was.
it will never be patched
the feelings seem gone to you
for me, they linger
and pop out of the blue
they stick and won't go away.
i dont have a way to express them
so i hide them every day
i wish i could rewind my life
back to that moment.
i would do everything different
and maybe now i wouldn't have this dent
and maybe... just maybe...
i would still have you.
it was true love from the start
the touch of your hand,
and the taste of your kiss.
oh how i wonder,
how our love is as strong as this.
the sound of your voice,
and the twinkle in your eye.
oh how i thank god,
for such a wonderful guy.
the warmth of your smile,
and the touch upon your face.
oh how i love,
your caringness and embrace.
the way you look into my eyes,
and the safeness when i'm with you.
oh how i'm so happy,
now that i'm with you.
the touch of your body,
and the feel of your hands on me.
oh how i see,
that this is truly meant to be.
the love in your heart,
and the glistening in your eyes.
oh how i believe,
that nothing will tear us apart.
the words upon your lips,
and the determination on your mind.
oh how i love,
when your hands are on my hips.
the beat of your heart,
and the bravery in your soul.
oh how i knew,
it was true love from the start.
it wasn't our fate
you dont know how it feels
to miss someone like you
you were my everything,
you were perfect
you made me feel perfect
you were everything
and the only thing
i had that was good in my life
then you are gone
and i'm cheating myself
trying to match that love
as i watch you trying to do the same
i know you dont love me anymore
and i know everything is gone
i'm happy it happened
but im sad it has ended
and the thought knowing
it will never happen again is devasting
it wasn't meant to be
it wasn't our fate.
joy of my heart
dear joy of my heart,
i am weary ~ so weary
of thinking of you.
memories linger in my head,
memoirs start me thinking
love could never be dead.
i see a picture quite clearly
of your two eyes of blue,
i tell you now with sincerity
there is no forgetting you,
because i love you dearly,
i always thought you knew.
dear joy of my heart,
i am weary ~ so weary
of thinking of you.
just for you
as i sit here all alone
i think of only you
i think of how i love you
and how you make me feel
i think of what could be
a wish come true
for you to love me too
i'm holding on to my love for you
and hoping one day soon
you will love me
like i love you.
just in case tomorrow never comes
my heart forever lies with you
and i know that you love me too
i want you to know just how i feel
and that this feeling is real.
tonight i wanna let go of all my fears
cry all of my uncried tears
hear all of the things i wanna hear,
know that you'll always be near.
because love can be so beautiful
especially when i'm with you
kiss me like there's no tomorrow
just in case tomorrow never comes.
warmth spreads throughout me at your touch
love spreads throughout me from your kiss
all i can think is, 'i love him so much
and i want him to know i'm glad i'm his.
because love can be so beautiful
but mostly when i'm with you
kiss me like there's no tomorrow
just in case tomorrow never comes.
we've reached a level of understanding
far beyond what i ever imagined
i don't know what i'd do without you,
your sweet love and lingering kiss.
because love can be so beautiful
but only when i'm with you
kiss me like there's no tomorrow
just in case tomorrow never comes.
just like before
everything was perfect
nothing at all was wrong
we matched every love song
i loved the way you touched
the feeling was such a rush
i cant explain it
i thought i would last a long bit
then i became silent
you broke it off from there
we didnt talk
everything was hushed
it didnt matter anymore
we were apart
just like before the start
just to be me
the sun is setting on a lonely day
the colours are splitting, the perfect way
your strolling home as you see this too
and i watch from a window thinking of you
from this day on, ill look forever
that magical sunset, our memories together
to help me through when my life gets tough
and when i feel that ive had enough
the sun you see, makes me think of you
the miracle of it, the wonder too
i see you both everyday as you know
to stop seeing either, id have to say, no
the bright colours shine from within my heart
the colours of a sunset, a special part
of a day in my life i wish you could see
just whats its like, just to be me.
as i looked into your eyes
i knew something was wrong
and then you said goodbye
we had been together too long
you said you didn't feel for me
the same way i did for you
and after years of our love
we were actually through
i said you won't go
you said you can't stay
but how was i supposed to know
it would all end that day
i told you how much i would miss
each and every day
and that was when we kissed
and you turned and walked away.
let me be the one
let me be your sun
i will shine when day is done
let me be the one.
love for you i cannot hide
and a lake of tears i've cried.
was love but a dream
with a passion so extreme?
fairytales are dreams!
i need you here, you need me
this is our reality.
rapture fills the air
when i see you standing there
smiling ~ debonair.
come home to me, always stay
music sweet will charm each day.
pain will float away
and we'll dance to love's refrain
danube waltz again.
red parasol will unfold
two "gentle doves" to behold.
...  so  ...
let me be your sun
i will shine when day is done
let me be the one.
love for you i cannot hide
and a lake of tears i've cried.
let me love you
oh, what can i do to let you know my heart is for real,
sitting at the beach only the stars could tell you,
let me love you for no reason, for no return,
swinging with the waves of ocean, who am i speaking to;
oh, what can i do to let you know how much i feel for you,
wishing to the clouds let me see the moon,
let me love you for no reason, for no return,
shivering in the wind, oh, where are you;
let me love you, oh, let me love you,
not for my loneliness but for you,
let me love you, oh, let me love you,
i whispering in my heart, oh god, let me love you...
lie still my love
lie still my love, sleep on til the morn,
as i lie here, let me watch you sleeping,
so quiet and so warm,
i cradle you in my loving arms, just like an innocent child,
a handsome man, so nice, so kind and with a manner so mild,
beside me you lie as you dream,
your loving heart beating slowly,
i whisper to you softly those three most precious words "i love you",
your endless dreams are yours to hold,
in the shadows of sleep, they continue to unfold,
but dream on my darling, until the morn,
as i lie beside you so quiet and so warm.

like a rose
my love for you is like a red, red rose,
listen to me baby
please listen to me baby,
you are my own sweet lady,
with you i'm meant to be
and tomorrow we will see
blue skies everywhere.
a hotel stands in waiting
rose gardens near the sea
two hearts anticipating
a romance of ecstasy.
so hush your painful crying,
very soon we will be flying
once again i'll hear you sing
on a holiday in spring
no sadness anywhere.
a hotel stands in waiting
rose gardens near the sea
two hearts anticipating
a romance of ecstasy.
if i had a heart i'm sure it would say
how lonely its been since you went away,
with no one to snuggle and no one to hold.
i guess i'll adjust, or so i've been told.
it's hard to sit back as the line seems to grow
and watch all the flirting, when deep down i know
there's nobody there who can know your heart
or feel your thoughts even though apart.
to know your thoughts with just one word
without the others being heard.
to feel your heart and share what you love
like some magic secret from up above.
the music flows and so do the smiles
from you to them across the miles.
even our songs that were special there
are followed by smiles for all to share.
i guess it's me... i just don't understand
you told me you loved me and held my hand.
how can i trust anything you say,
when i'm yesterdays news the very next day.
if i had a heart it would beat in place
instead of having this empty space.
and yours would beat along with mine,
and i'd be yours til the end of time.
come to me in my dreams, and then
by day i shall be well again.
for then the night will more than pay
the hopeless longing of the day.
come, as thou cam'st a thousand times,
a messenger from radiant climes,
and smile on thy new world, and be
as kind to others as to me.
or, as thou never cam'st in sooth,
come now, and let me dream it truth.
and part my hair, and kiss my brow,
and say my love! why sufferest thou?
come to me in my dreams, and then
by day i shall be well again.
for then the night will more than pay
the hopeless longing of the day.
happiness is the longing for repetition. ~ milan kundera
longing for your sweetheart is a sure sign of love. ~ gabor timis
longing for the one you love
for the longest time
have i longed to touch thy face
to kiss thy beautiful lips
and feel the warmth of thine embrace.
for the longest time
have i longed to hold thee near
and whisper sweet caresses
from my mouth into your ears.
for the longest time
have i longed to sing out loud
of the passion that i'll feel
when we dance beneath the clouds.
for the longest time
have i longed to be with thee
to join my heart with your soul
until you're the greatest part of me.
for the longest time
will you and i be together
until our fantasies have become realities
and our spirits have become one forever.
looking through my eyes
like the nights before today,
the memories of you and me haunts me again like yesterday,
tomorrow will bring more sorrow,
of the love that i see no more,
the morning sun that rises brings no longer the ray of light,
hiding itself behind the clouds,
the nights that felt so warm before,
now cold and harsh,
i searched my soul to find myself,
and the journey never seemed to end,
for i lost it not in me,
but i lost it in you,
the mornings will never be the same,
the evenings only brings me more pain,
only when i close my eyes,
can the storms calm itself,
for it is when you are in my arms,
where you whispers those words of love i long to hear,
where you heal me with your touch,
where my dreams are reality.
my love for you is so passionate and true
i wish i could prove this to you
i will climb the highest mountain to touch the sky
and bring down that rainbow so high in the sky.
oh if i could prove to you that my love is real
i'd swim  that river oh so wide to prove
that you are my joy and pride
and my love is so real.
but all these things are so impossible for me
to do i can't climb a mountain oh so high and
bring down that rainbow from the sky, and no
i can't swim that river that is oh so wide.
but to prove my love is true and
i really want to be with you is say
i love you and mean it with all my heart!

sometimes hidden, other times known.
often true, perhaps not.
sometimes feels like fire, other times not felt at all.
can be cold as cyan sadness, or hot as crimson passion.
perhaps today, possibly never.
can be love at first sight, or built over time.
can be revealed, or kept secret.
may be returned, or turned down.
cannot be exclaimed by keeping to thyself,
cannot be expressed by saying simple words of the mind,
the only way is by saying words from the heart.
felt by the heart, not by the mind.
cannot be explained or defined.
how can it be professed?
the answer lies in thy own heart.
the only way to find it
is by looking for it thyself.
love is something that is not easily explained
no one word can express it
and no one person feels the same about it
the love of my life is
someone special, it's true
he's someone i want to be with always
my special someone is you.
will you be mine forever
is what i want to know
every time we're together
my love continues to grow.
the love i feel for you
is one i've never knew
everything you do for me
tells me you love me too.
i love the gifts you give me
they show me that you care
each one also gives a promise
a promise you'll be there.
i'll love you forever
until the day i die
i'll be forever by you
trust me - i wouldn't lie.
you picked me up and wrapped me
in a warm blanket of love.
you swept me up and dusted off
webs of hurts inside.
you gave me warmth
you sheltered me
from life's stormy skies.
now i live in a home where love abides.
you held me tight.
where there was darkness,
you gave me light.
now the world seems real bright.
in the place where love abides,
you showered me with kisses,
saw through my heart to love,
chased away the darkness
with unconditional love.
together we dwell forever
in the place where love abides.
send this poem to a friend
we are on a similar wavelength
in all that we do and say!
he agrees with me, and tells me
to go ahead in the same old way.
i nod to him in confirmation
with energy and determination.
two of a feather, god brought us together
and each day is the first day of may
the feeling of love will not sever
he and i will be loyal forever
because we are on the same wavelength
in all that we do and say.
love forever, till heaven calls. ~ gabor timis
love is ...
it's having someone to be with
someone you can't be without
it's wanting to hold them every second
that's what its all about.
it's the happiness you feel
when everythings gone wrong
it's the way you sit there
and think of crazy love songs.
it's the sadness in your heart
when you know their not there
it's the safeness you have
when you are feeling scared.
it's the hope you have
when everythings gone
it's the dreams you hold
when your alone.
it's having someone to talk to
when noone else is listening
it's being so in love
that nothing in your life is missing.
it's knowing i love you
and i'll love you forever
it's thinking of you every second
thats what true love is!
love is the greatest
to love is to have someone special
one who you can always depend
to be there through the years
sharing laughter and tears
as a partner, a lover, a friend.
to love is to make special memories
of moments you love to recall
of all the good things
that sharing life brings
love is the greatest of all.
love is the greatest of all feelings. - gabor timis
love of my life
a zest for life, a grace divine
more intoxicating than wine.
carefree nature and wild, wild ways,
you always make my mind sway!
bouncing black hair and coal- dark eyes,
remind me of monsoon skies,
a spring in your step elevates my mood,
hey, nosey rain, do not intrude!
as the wind caresses your lovely form,
and the waves rush to feel your charm,
what chance do i stand?
against nature's wicked game plan?
there is no truth but love;
lovely as the blue skies above.
there is no reality but bliss,
so there! let me taste your lips.
let me hold you in my arms,
and protect you from all harm,
life is too cruel, my dear!
but, i am here, do you hear?
spend an eternity with me,
i shall never tire of you,
remind me when day breaks,
for, yet again, i will want to hold you.
love poems index
love of my life
silver streaks of moonlight shine in your eyes whenever you look at me
the sun rises in your eyes my darling
when you dream of holding the moon,
i catch it and bring it to you, wrapped in red-watery rose petals
i lay red roses for your feet to walk on
i see your face on every moonrise
your face is on every sunrise
my beautiful darling, i can never count the ways i love you
your eyes sparkle like diamond
your smile brightens my days like the sun
love of my life
sunshine of my morning
moonlight of my nights.
what is the glory far above
all else in human life?
there is no form in which the fire
of love its traces has impressed not.
man lives far more in love's desire
than by life's breath, soon possessed not.
if all that lives nust love or lie,
all shapes on earth, or sea, or sky,
with one consent, to
that the glory far above
all else in life is--
love! o, love!
thou melancholy thought, which art
so fluttering and so sweet, to thee
when did i give the liberty
thus to afflict my heart?
what is the cause of this new power
which doth my fevered being move,
momently raging more and more?
what subtle pain is kindled now,
which from my heart doth overflow
into my senses?
love! o, love!
love's heavenly bliss
i want to remember when our souls
were entwined into one spirit.
i remember the soft touch of your breast
and the heavenly bliss into which i soared.
i think of you as we explore passions of love
so hot that fires rage within our souls.
i remember as we touched each other
in ways that only lovers can.
the passions that lift our souls into the heavens
will live forever in our hearts.
our hearts will soar higher
than the highest mountain,
yes and even higher than the eagle.
our quest for love has given peace
within our hearts and tranquility never dreamed.
our love will satisfy our deepest desires
and our hearts will melt into one.
let us remember the lust of our flesh
is the lust of our heart and soul,
for when we are as one
then our spirits shall soar within
the heavens and only peace can dwell within our souls.
love's last word
oh the pain of love,
oh the pain of fate,
with love unrequited
souls can be blighted.
better never to have
known love at all,
than to live a life
of pathetic recall.
send this poem to a friend
love you in silence
you came into my life
quietly, simply, tenderly...
the world stood still
i could not say a word
nor a single gestured showed.
the feeling kept in my heart
so i've loved you in silence
worshipped ypu from a distance
and dreamt of you so often.
i want to say i love you,
but i'm afraid...
afraid that you'll just take it for granted.
in silence then, i'll just love you.
in silence i'll find...
the fulfillment of my dreams.
fond words i write within my prose
sweet words of love for you alone
my heart cries out where'er i go
for you to be my very own.
my mind is with you, rain or snow
and when the winter breezes blow
sometimes i'm high, often i'm low,
all because i love you so.
life is short as you well know
so meet me where the lily grows
without your love, there is no prose
no words come from a dying rose.
my heart is yours, for you to own
i sing love songs for you alone.
can you see how i adore you?
bliss brings lovelight to my eyes
you speak ~ i hear a symphony
flowers dance, the bluebird flies.
when first we met, i just knew
no other soulmate could there be
to settle deep within my heart
and cherish its key eternally.
playing our parts for all to see ...
we are "sylvia and dante rossetti"
whene'er we talk, where'er we walk
moon and stars sprinkle confetti.
bliss brings lovelight, never gloom
shall we dance where roses bloom?
open your ears
as your eyes let down their tears
upon hearing my song for you,
a song of a love that is so true.
this is my love song.
it's not that long,
but it does portray
the feelings that i cannot say.
so, to you, i will sing
of the love that will always ring
in my heart, my dove.
listen as i sing this song of love,
a song to describe you
and all that you do.
my ears will ring
and my heart will sing
at the thought of seeing you.
i only wish you'd love me too.
and now i must go,
i will see you again, my wonderful doe.
my time is nigh,
i love you, and good-bye.

my thoughts, my dreams
i never thought they would come true.
days went by
and i was still dreaming of you.
the feeling i get it can't be defined
when i look into your eyes, and you look into mine.
i ache at night cause im not with you
i wish so much that i could kiss you.
your eyes, your heart, your touch
kristen you mean so much.
your on my mind 24/7
when im with you i feel like i'm in heaven.
ive made mistakes in the past
things the same, never seem to last.
im sorry for all that i've done to you
but no matter what, i will always love you.
loving you is easy
there is so much i want to share with you,
but my words are lost within me
i have so many emotions
how do i make you see
life is not that simple
hear this from my heart
our love will concur all
as we stand here at the start.
not speaking to you is killing me
you there and me here
but one day soon that will change
and i will finally have you near.
the angels they did send you
the day that we met
our love will last forever
as in concrete it is set
come fly, fly with me baby
oh come fly with me
we can explore our love together
and set our emotions free
for the skies are without limits
and the tree tops we sour too
perched upon a branch
our love is forever true
i never meant for this to happen
but i am sure glad it did
hearing your love and laughter
makes me feel like a kid
please never doubt my love
what is shared between you and me
cause i am here to hold you
you just wait and see
but for now, i have to be patient
and except our destiny
but i promise you this my darling
you are forever within me.
madly in love
i can't explain why i feel this way,
everytime you would come my way
i always tremble, feelin nervous,
it's like i wanna fall down unconcious.
i don't know what so special about you
that made me fall in love with you.
maybe that cute face of yours,
your smiles and ways, yes of course
everytime you're by my side
i'd like to stretch my hands open wide
and embrace you tight endlessly
but i can't, you might turn away from me.
so what can i do,
if this is what i feel for you
can you blame me, if i have fallen
madly in love with you my darling.
man of my heart
spring comes with the sun
cold winds there are none
"man of my heart" - he's the one.
i gazed at him once
i gazed at him twice
this was the start of paradise.
he gazed back at me
he gazed lovingly
i heard the notes of a symphony.
we gazed at each other
and our daydreams took flight
beautiful wedding of white.
spring comes with the sun
cold winds there are none
"man of my heart" - you're the one.
meet me in the shadows of your heart,
the place only you and i know exists.
take me with you and hold me in your arms.
meet me in the stars above,
the place the highest goals live.
see the light of love shining in my eyes.
meet me at the ocean's edge,
the place where the water cleanses.
take me to a place of absolute purity.
meet me at the forest's clearing,
the place where the trees part.
where we are sheltered and safe.
meet me in the billowy clouds,
the place where heaven and earth touch.
dance with me in the sky and share our joy.
meet me on the mountain's peak.
the place where you can breathe deeply.
inhale my essence and make it yours.
meet me, my love....
anywhere, anytime, anyplace.
share my soul and be one with me.
can i fade in your arms?
can i get lost in your eyes?
'cause when i'm with you
i just melt away
can i render you still?
freeze this tmoment in time?
'cause when i see you
i just melt away
can i stay close to you
until the river runs dry?
'cause when you're heart is by mine
i just melt away
memories long and pleasant spent
of touch and thoughts of you,
of kisses deep and heaven sent,
and in your arms i grew.
of loving life with dreams replete,
our souls combined, yet still,
how sudden ended and complete,
the anger - love did kill.
sorrow quickly took its course,
now life, its beauty spent,
and all i own is deep remorse,
for the dreams we never dreamt.
at times i drift on golden strands,
and dream of you once more,
praying - clasping desperate hands,
wait! i hear a knocking at the door.
memories of love are cherished all our lives. ~ gabor timis
memory of roses
sorrow i feel, for i must leave you
standing in the midnight air;
my heart belongs to a family of roses,
your heart belongs to a maiden fair.
each of us made our promises
to keep the vows and keep them well.
i cannot stay, i must not linger,
the time has come to say farewell.
i shall miss your kindly gestures
cheering this heart and soul of mine.
someday soon we will surely meet
when romance and music combine.
until then,  my wonderful one,
you will sleep deep within my mind.
i kiss you now... for i am leaving
to greet the roses i left behind.
i could look at your face forever
i could hold your hand for all time.
if i could have one granted wish,
it would be that you are mine.
i dream about you all the time
and they way you look at me.
i love hearing you whisper "goodnight"
i love you so much, can't you see?
that i'm crazy for your smile,
and your beautiful glossy eyes.
and when you hang with me
you don't need to find a disguise.
you're real around me and i love it.
i love everything you do.
i can't bare to be separated,
so i'll stick to you like glue.
i could look at your face forever
i could hold you in my heart for all time.
so there's only one question left for you to answer,
will you please be mine?
i'm missing you like crazy
i think i'm going mad
i simply can't stop thinking
of the special times we had.
each moment lasts an hour
each hour lasts a day
the clock is ticking slowly
just because you went away.
i need you here beside me
i just want to see your face
to feel your precious heartbeat
and be lost in your embrace.
i gaze out of the window
and look up at the moon
i play the waiting game
and pray you'll be here soon.
they say hope springs eternal
well i only hope it's true
for i can't bare the emptiness
that comes from missing you.
you are the one who i always think,
i even see your face everytime i blink.
i really don't know why am i acting like this,
all i know that it is you who i miss.
when i think about you, my eyes seemed to glow,
when i dream of you, i hoped for no tomorrow.
to be with you right now is what i've wished
'coz it is really you whom my heart has missed.
i believe that we will be together sooner or later.
how i hope that the time and day will pass faster
so that i'll be with you and hug you tight,
and never let go of you with all my might.
'coz i really miss you and boy that is true.
missing you like crazy
sometimes at night,
when i lay down to sleep,
i embrace myself,
i start to think ...
then i imagine
that you lie beside me ...
hugs and kisses
all over my body.
i wish you
could really be here,
just to whisper,
"i love you," in my ear.
i would turn around and say,
"i love you, too."
but will it ever be true?
so i turn around
and i wonder some more,
still wanting your embrace,
so i close my eyes and picture your face.
i fall asleep dreaming of you.
in my dream it seems so true.
it's as if i can really feel
your kisses against my lips ...
then my eyes pop open
and you're nowhere to be seen,
and i feel so lonely
once again !!!
i see myself holding you close to me,
squeezing your body tight.
but for all i see as i daydream-
i know i'll get tenfold tonight.
running my palms across your breast,
as you tremble and bite your lip.
feeling your hands upon my chest,
the softness of each fingertip.
tasting your neck so sweet, so soft,
and slowly lowering my kiss.
over pert nipples, across your navel,
and finally into pure bliss.
looking upon your face from below-
as you tilt back your head.
feeling your fountains begin to flow-
as you ease back on the bed.
your "innocent little devil" look-
crying insatiably with the sensation.
lip to lip lapping up every drip-
from the well of your creation.
the way you pull me up by the hair-
to the heat of your mouth, on fire.
no other thoughts, no other cares,
just the quenching of mad desire.
riding the tide of passion,
pushing my love into you.
on the waves of your emotion-
in slow motion, so sweet and true.
pulse pounding in resounding rapture,
taken to the hilt, then just past.
rhythm growing, faces glowing,
the climax coming fast.
that heated, illicit look-
of ecstasy across your eyes.
the culmination nearing-
within your undulating thighs.
echoing throughout the heavens-
on overindulgent cries.
the sultry look upon your face-
in reaching that gyrating gush.
the way you bite my fingers-
when i try to make you hush.
your arching back, your fingernails,
your perfume mixed with sweat.
the way you keep rubbing against me-
with your insides already so wet.
the way when i'm beat dead and ready-
to fall face first to the floor,
you put your sweet lips to my ear-
and whisper, "i want more! "
i go crazy
with one touch of your hand
my dreams fulfilled
with one look in your eyes
saying "i love you"
is what i love to hear
when you wrap me in your arms
and hold me oh so near
i'm so happy
to be here by your side
i cry within
'cause, boy, you are so sweet
you belong to me
and i belong to you
and, boy, to stay by your side
there's nothing i won't do
i won't forget
the way you make me feel
when i am blue
you know just what to say
i will stay here in love
'cause, boy, you are my blessing
from heaven up above.
love poems index
seasons of my life,
winter, spring, summer and fall
i've held the emotions
and felt them all
spring, of new beginnings
summer of hot desires
fall a comfort zone
winter, family and friends
of all of these
i feel within you
like a calendar of each day
each day a new mark
of what i haven't had
of what i have forgotten
all given as a beautifully wrapped package
each day open with surprise
how do i forget
how do i move on
like a winters snow
the flakes just keep falling
each one a delight on my face
trying to catch them on my tongue
to taste for one moment
a feeling of delight
i thank you for each moment
a new memory with each day that comes
holding on as tight as i can
hoping to never let go.
send this poem to a friend
i close my eyes,
and i see his face
i feel his touch,
his warm embrace
i hear his voice,
he whispers so
says he'll never
let me go
he smells so good,
it feels so right
i beg him please,
to hold me tight
he runs his fingers
through my hair
caresses my skin,
his touch so fair
and then he presses
his lips to mine
my body quivers,
with feelings divine
and just as i feel
i haven't a care,
i open my eyes,
to find he's not there
was it all in my head?
does my dream man exist?
i feel a great sadness,
as i ask myself this
then as i look up,
as if out of the blue
i see your sweet smile,
and i reach out to you
you gladly reach back,
with your arms open wide
the moment stands still,
a love frozen in time
you are the man,
of which i had dreamed
i've waited forever,
or so it has seemed
to share these feelings,
so pure, so true
i want to shout it out loud...
i love you!
my endless love
i loved you the moment
i saw your precious face.
you took hold of my heart;
made it your own special place.
no one comes before you
and no one loves you more.
when you came into my life,
you made my spirit soar.
i can only love you
until the day i die.
i pray you will be there
when it's time to say goodbye.
take my hand and hold me;
help my spirit fly.
let your face be the last
i see before i die.
you are my endless love.
i look at you and can only see,
my love, my life, my eternity.
with you there is no end,
let's hold each other, our love to tend.
in this chaotic world of ours,
one thing is for sure in my heart.
you finish the circle throughout my life,
like a never ending fire through the night.
mystic colors swirl 'round,
only for you will they die down.
keep me on your mind and in your thoughts,
what we have, my love, cannot be bought.
my first true love
so many years ago we loved
we love still
we will love forever
my heart was broken
now it is mended
each new day begins
and my heart sings
to the feel of your love
and the beat of your heart
at night i sleep
with you in my heart
it beats only for you my love
each beat matched by yours
i long for the time
that we spend together
each snatched moment
i will treasure
you eyes they shine
with your love for me
so tender and caring
so full of love
if i cannot have you to myself
i will treasure each moment that we have
forever my darling
you are my soul
our hearts are linked
by the bond we share
each thought we have
we also care
to you my love
i give my all
and my soul
you are the stars in the sky
the wind on my face
the rain in my eyes
the tears on my cheeks
you are the biggest part of me
that i cannot deny
as i sit here with a tear in my eye
a tear of joy shed only for you
for all you are
for all you can be
this i am grateful for
till the day i die
you are my world
you are my life
you are my soul.
my forever love
it wasn't til that day i met you
that i'd fall in love with someone
so special as you
when i first saw you,
i knew you were the one
when i look at you,
i just want to melt
when you hold me
i never want you to let go
i want to be in your arms forever
i dream that someday we will be one
i will always love you
tell me you love me
i know you do
i know i love you!
i love for you is forever!
my forever love
my heart and i
love you so my dear
to you ~ i take a bow
this love is sincere
no new beginnings now.
to you ~ i take a bow,
we have loved for years
let's shout it out aloud
no fears and no tears.
this love is sincere
my soul ~ it tells no lie
when you hold me near
we sing - my heart and i.
no new beginnings now
needn't change our ways
you and i made a vow
to last all our days.
my heart sings
a long, interesting life
bringing me to this point
no longer upon the edge
pulling out of my free fall
no longer feeling small
your love pulling me back
it has been there all along
life preserver upon my sea
now that i have taken the ring
i can feel my heart sing
candle light soft and flickering
showing me the way
my hand searching for yours
finding you within the infernal night
your love making my world right
comfort within your smile
lost in the love light of your eyes
mesmerized by all you do
feeling all the love you have for me
knowing that my heart runs free
take my hand and do not let go
guide me down the path aglow
shimmering under the glorious light
love bringing us together
hearing the wind whisper "forever".
my heart & soul claim you
you have promised a new life to me,
you have promised to satisfy my needs,
humble flower of all my dreams,
the most essential deed of my dreams!
even though sometimes i could be sad,
i can be impressed by your aimless furies,
but i'm still attracted by your smooth love.
assuage me with your romantic words!
cajole me with your soft, tender voice,
remain always very close to me.
allow me to judge my reactions.
i'm still waiting for your forgiveness.
thus, i'm imploring you painfully,
honourable rose of my worships,
the one who makes my heart vibrate,
the only one my restless soul claims,
so far, i'm running out of options.
my heart is craving for your love,
my soul, in other hand, is questing for you
will you think of returning close to them?
send this poem to a friend
i look deep in your eyes.
i see there what i feel inside.
we share something between us,
neither one of us can hide.
i feel your lips touch mine,
i loose all my control,
all it took was a look and a kiss,
to know you were part of my soul.
i see your hands on my skin,
i want and need you to do more,
the passionate look you give me,
tells me heaven is in store.
i feel your need against my thigh,
i know you will fulfill every wish,.
we were made to fit together,
and all it took was a look and a kiss.
i look deep in your eyes,
and i see heaven there inside,
you make me feel so beautiful,
what i feel for you i cannot hide.
my gentle place
this gentle place is where i go
to escape torments of life
a gentle place it is although
that shuts out bitter strife.
this gentle place, where i go
on earth, with heaven above
i find myself searching
for my one and only love
within this gentle place of mine,
where i shall close my eyes
using judgment purely divine
not fooled by simple disguise.
in this gentle place of mine
i see him oh more clearly
the most loving man on earth
i give my heart sincerely.
like the whisper of an angel,
his words put my soul at rest
it is then, at that very moment
i know im truly blessed.
to feel his breath upon my skin,
and the sweet taste of his kiss
i find myself lost within
i feel nothing but pure bliss.
his touch, as soft as a feather
tracing the path of my desire
the touch bringing us closer together
to join our passionate fire
his lips upon my naked flesh
im lost within the second
our burning bodies begin to mesh
the beauty of the flowers beckoned.
and it is at that very minute
when all time shall be stilled
with only him and me in it
all our fantasies fulfilled.
gazing in each others eyes
where true happiness exists
all sadness and loneliness dies
and heartache is dismissed.
it is you, my darling man
that is my great escape
from all the bitterness of the world
you are my gentle place.
my life with you
i've lived my life in a chaotic world
i see the darkness as my days unfold.
the trembling of my heart i feel,
as sadness embraces me from head to heel.
and now that i've found you
everything so right and true.
you are the sparkle in my eyes
you've filled lovin' with all my cries.
you've mastered my fears
and eradicated my tears.
my sun burns even brighter,
my life seems so much happier.
because of you i've learned that life is no misery
now i know love is kept for eternity.
i've searched even the deepest sea,
but there's nothing like the love you've given me
i love you honey...
love poems index
my love, oh how i long for you
in your arms i ache to be
without you my heart would stop
for it beats for only thee
it beats for only thee my love
you inspire it to thrive
you have given life to me my love
and made me come alive
alive, i am for you my love
every breath takes you in
my heart beats strong for you my love
then it stops and beats again
it stops for only moments
to pace itself a while
for it's racing fast for you my love
in a moment it's raced a mile
i love you, oh my dearest love
i love you more each day
never once shall you ask to hear it
for each chance 'i love you' i'll say
i love you again and again
i love you with all my heart
i can not wait to love you more
and for my life with you to start
my love you are my only
the one i trust and treasure
my love for you runs freely
and flows without end or measure
i love you oh my love
with all that i am i love you
i love you oh my love
with a love that i hold true.
my love is like an ocean
it goes down so deep
my love is like a rose
whose beauty you want to keep.
my love is like a river
that will never end
my love is like a dove
with a beautiful message to send.
my love is like a song
that goes on and on forever
my love is like a prisoner
it's to you that i surrender.
of all that i can give,
i give you my heart and soul.
nothing can ever compare;
my love after you
the sun rises once again,
awakening me from the calm of night before,
where i could hear nothing but the sound of silence,
where i could feel nothing but the breathing of my soul,
with the majesty of the morning sun,
comes with it the sorrows of my life,
where the realities of losing you haunts me,
where the shadows of the past taunts me,
cries of mine to you to return,
falls upon the grounds below,
like the autumn leaves which drops from the tree up above,
like the droplets of rain from the clouds beyond reach,
the woe within my heart,
hides between the shadows of the dark,
praying for the night,
for it all to go away again.
my love for you
my love for you is unconditional
my love for you is real
my love for you is something
so incredible to feel
holding you on those summer nights
feeling your soft kiss with the sun
my love for you is something
that never once had to be won
i love you with the passing days
and with those we have not seen
you are the one in all my thoughts
in all my living dreams
you are the one whose hand is in mine
whose lips i can't ignore
you are my life, my world, my love
you're all that i adore.
my love for you
my love for you surpasses all the beauties of the world,
the rivers that run deep, deeper does my love run,
the clouds up in the sky, higher does my love rise,
the oceans and lands far and wide, farther does my love reach,
my love for you surpasses my own feelings,
hurt i might be to see you walk away from me,
but the joys to see you happy, shall take it all away from me,
cry as i might not to have you,
harder shall i cry to see you hurt,
my love for you surpasses all of these,
my love for you surpasses me.
my love for you
my love for you is deep and true
no matter what you do
i'll always be there for you
no matter where you go
i'll always be there beside you
till the day i die
my love will always stay true to you
my love for you i can't ignore
my love for you i can't ignore;
my heart i need not let explore.
for one day my darling in time you will see.
your love for me, it was meant to be.
until that day i vow unto you;
to love you, be faithful and always be true.
please my love, i'll do the right thing.
never let go, hold me under your wing.
for i have no desire to venture away;
i'll never let go, i'm here to stay.
so as long as you love me, one day you'll well know.
our love for each other, in time it will grow.
my love is like to ice
my love is like to ice, and i to fire:
how come it then that this her cold is so great
is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
but harder grows the more i her entreat?
or how comes it that my exceeding heat
is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,
but that i burn much more in boiling sweat,
and feel my flames augmented manifold?
what more miraculous thing may be told,
that fire, which is congealed with senseless cold,
should kindle fire by wonderful device?
such is the power of love in gentle mind,
that it can alter all the course of kind.

my love is where you are
if i could catch a million stars,
i know just what i'd do,
i'd arrange them on a paper,
and sing them back to you.
if i could give you gifts of gold,
i'd have each one inscribed,
with a special memory,
that i hold, dear, inside.
i'd give you everything you'd want,
or you could ever need,
but that would never measure,
all you've given me.
with honesty and compassion,
you lend a tender ear.
and when i look into your eyes,
my troubles disappear.
but, i am not a rich man,
nor lucky enough to catch a star,
i can only give you one thing...
all that's in my heart.
this is something you'll never be without,
whether you are near or far,
for it is a simple but precious gift.
my love is where you are.
my one and only
since the day we first met,
i knew it was love,
god answered my prayers,
you came down from above...
you gave me your heart,
and taught me to trust,
for the first time ever,
it was more than just lust...
your sweet loving words,
are not to be compared,
i am forever your partner,
my soul i have bared...
every day i wake up,
with a smile a mile long,
i know that we are solid,
i know that we are strong...
so never put into question,
my feelings being true,
because i have found my one and only,
and i will always love you.

my painful love
why does it have to hurt inside?
why do i have to cry each night?
i think i have to walk on by...
cuz i'm starting to lose my sight...
what is it that changed your mind?
who is it that keeps you blind?
why did you change so fast?
did you really have to leave me behind?
i start to think about all we had
and how it turned this way...
i guess i'll have to leave your side,
and turn my face away...
although my soul will die...
although my heart will cry...
i've got nothing else to do,
i'm hurt deep inside
but although i'll leave your side,
you'll be always on my mind...
my heart and soul will ache for you,
every day and every night...
you're my never-ending love,
the love that keeps me alive...
you're the one i'll love forever,
although it hurts inside...
my promise to you
i'll never forget,
the first that we met,
i remember it like it was yesterday,
it's stays deep in my heart,
the day you found me.
we have promised that we would give
to each other all there is to give
for as long as we both shall live.
i never want wealth or fame,
i only want to have your name,
i only want to wear
that tiny band of gold
and always have to you hold.
i will keep my promise to you,
i will never be untrue,
even though sometimes i  will be
away from you.
i will never break your heart,
i've always loved you from the start,
i must say to you this very special day,
i won't let it take my pride,
i want to be your bride.
i will never let you feel empty inside,
i will never break the ties that bind,
i will never leave you behind,
i will never let our love die.
so i make another promise to you, my love,
we will live and we will learn,
and where ever you may go,
my heart will always follow.
and now it's plain to see,
the the promise's that i have made to thee,
will show in time, you see,
that you and i will never be lonely,
i love this you and me.
my secret passions
i dream of fragrant flowered nights,
of passioned love and sweet delights;
such moments of my life do stay
alive within my mind each day.
great passions lie in the prison keep
of my yearning heart, so dark and deep;
and will remain in silence there,
unless, somehow, you start to care.
they can't be properly conveyed
to you, my love, through poems made.
they need to be expressed to you,
in hopes that love will then ensue.
they wait for the precious light of day,
which only you can bring my way.
they wait for me to set them free,
but only you possess the key.

my undying love
i love you like the sun in the sky
or maybe how a bird is destined to fly
even more than a mother loves her child
or all the animals running in the wild
a pedal to a rose
and everyone knows
it's more that just love
soring around like a white turtle dove
tears for joy and tears for pain
it's like standing out in the hot summer rain
it's more than the sound of your sweet gentle name
more than a predetor loves its game
words can't sum up the way that i feel
but i'll definetly say
these feelings are real
and as sent from above
im here to give you my undying love
so in closing my dear
i pray i've made it rather clear
you mean everything to me
my sweet heart can't you see
i can't get enough of your endless touch
oh my sweet baby, i love you so much!
love poems index
i don't even know what you do to me
but it feels so good
you take over my body
like no one ever could
i've never felt this way before
i never want it to end
it feels so good the way it takes
over and over again
you don't even have to touch me
just say a single word
it lifts up my day
as if i am a bird
one day you'll get that feeling
of both pain and joy
and when you do you'll tell me
cause you'll always be my boy!
a whispered longing, a silenced tear
cherry-red lips, trembling with fear.
beautiful and amazing
it's hard to beleive you're mine
sweet and quite tempting
my heart is yours til the end of time.
my heart had not been inspired
since many, many moons ago
my body not set on fire
nor my skin given that warm glow.
your voice works a magic
deep within my soul
my desire surpasses logic
a desire only your would know.
this fire will soon be calmed
this need will soon be met
there's no longer a fear of being harmed
and my heart, with happiness has wept.
my wonderful sweet treasure
you've made my life complete.
love poems index
a new love, young love,
fresh and in bud,
exciting, heart racingly so,
though uncertain, exciting still
a breathless love full of longing
eagerness to be together
reluctance to part.
hand touching hand, pulse raising
heart full of love, head full of doubt
do they feel as i? am i just a fool?
will our love last?
will it blossom and grow
will it bare fruit?
or wither on the vine.
no one can take your dreams
there will always be a heartache,
and often a silent tear,
but always a million wishes,
wishing you were here.
there will always be your reflection,
in my lonely saddened stream,
and there will always be a 'you and me',
as long as i can dream.

now! not tomorrow
dance with me now ~
there is no tomorrow.
twist with me,
turn with me,
it's goodbye to sorrow.
let us take flight
for only one night.
hours we steal,
minutes we borrow.
love is everything,
songs divas sing.
dance with me now,
just show me how,
we will take wing

when there is nothing left to say
when you are faced with a choice
of whether to stay or walk away.

when you let pride get in the way
and when the problems seem too real.
what is there left
when there is nothing left to be spoken
when you realize it's a new day

when you finally realize

what is there left
when you cry for her gentle memory
when you cherish all you had
before her untimely tragedy.

not  yet kissed
we have not yet kissed
we have not touched each others heart
i have only sat back and hoped that
the other one would give this a start.
what would it be to touch your lips once?
what would it be to hold you every night?
what would it be to look into your eyes
and at the same time know i've seen the light.
words can only say so much
as to how i feel about you
actions can only come form the heart
therefore a kiss- would make my words true.

one last word
sitting in silence,
in the middle of the night,
not able to sleep,
because of our stupid fight.
love now lost,
so much pain,
its not all about you,
dont be so vain.
i dont know what to say
my feelings are mixed,
im wondering if ever,
things will be fixed.
i was so sad,
as you walked out the door,
our relationship broken,
but i couldnt take any more.
i didnt want us to end,
i want you to know,
ill always love you,
but cant let it show.
its too complicated,
and will always be,
i love you to bits,
but you cant be with me.
i have to tell you,
i believe in fate,
im waiting for god,
to find my sole mate.
i know im crazy,
but i believe in this,
and have no shame.
im so sorry,
im not right with you,
now im saying goodbye,
what else can i do?
one kiss is all i want
to take away my tears
and give me a healthy smile.
one kiss is all i want
to give me hope
and take on life as it comes.
one kiss is all i want
to know your lips
and hold them forever.
one kiss is all i want
to show you i love you
and be there for eternity.
if i could have just one wish
it would be to turn back time
to go back into the lonely past
to the days when you were mine.
if i could have just one wish
it would be to be with you
because i know that in my heart
my love is forever true.
if i could have just one wish
it would be to be in your arms
to have you hold me, touch me, kiss me
to keep me out of harm.
if i could have just one wish
the future is what i would see
so i could know if someday soon
you would be with me.
if i could have just one wish
i would be able to read people's minds
so i could hear your hopes, your fears
and hear what's going on inside.
if i could have just one wish
it would be to move on with my life
because you were my one true love
and you cut my heart like a knife.
if i could have just one wish
it would be to forget all about you
because you see i can't live with myself
knowing i'm not with you.
once upon a star
i gaze up at the sky each night
and find the brightest star.
it's always waiting there for me
so close, but yet so far.
the star winks in the evening sky
and reaches out to me.
it magically appears each night
for all the world to see.
i've wished upon this special star
my whole life through, it seems.
i've closed my eyes and made my wish
of hopes, and plans, and dreams.
and then, one day i got my wish
for i finally met you.
you are that someone special
who's made all my dreams come true.
so now whenever we're apart
i find that same bright star.
it makes me feel so close to you
no matter where you are.
only in dream
a candy-colored clown they call the sandman
tiptoes to my room every night
just to sprinkle star dust and to whisper
go to sleep, everything is all right.
i close my eyes then i drift away
into the magic night, i softly say
a silent prayer like dreamers do
then i fall asleep to dream of you.
in dreams i walk with you
in dreams i talk with you
in dreams you're mine all the time
we're together in dreams, in dreams.
but just before the dawn
i awake and find you gone
i can't help it,
i can't help it if i cry
i remember that you said goodbye.
too bad it only seems
it only happens in my dreams
only in dreams
in my beautiful dreams.
send this poem to a friend
on dreams of perfect love
a misty sunrise fills the east
with yellow, gold and red.
the bowl of space a palest blue,
sheds light upon our bed.
the warmth beside my soul, a feast
of love for only you.
so let the birds, with song, remain
within the morning hours,
to pour upon the crisp, new day
a hope, like cleansing showers.
for you i send refreshing rain
to wash the past away.
a quiet breeze so warm and slow,
i see your bright shining smile
as i make my way down the isle
as the preacher talks about love and life
i stand here proud to be your wife
binded together by trust and love
i remember the prayers to god above
now we are joined in spirit and heart
just as we were from the start
as everyone watches from their seat
our sacred vows we do repeat
in sickness and health-till death do us part
as i say these words- they come from my heart
rings exchanged-from you to me and me to you
my hands begin to shake-when you say "i do"
he says kiss the bride- you lift my veil
my heart skips a beat- beginning to sail
you kiss me so softly and kiss me so sweet
like the first time you swept me off my feet
as we are pronounced husband and wife
we walk hand in hand and begin our new life
i want to spend my life with you
these feelings inside i know are true
being away from you is hard to take
a wonderful life with you i'll make.
you and only you is what i live for
enjoying all of you yet wanting more
selfish at times, i can't let you go
loving you always this i tell you so.
some days are easy while others hard
the hand we play from dealing the cards
i'll stand by you no matter how long
our love is like the notes to a song.
creating a melody for everyone to hear
bringing with it laughter and tears
an inspiration for what love can be
a shining beacon for all to see.
our special place
when the sun falls on your face,
my world is lost in yours,
for we go to our special place,
there are no walls, windows, doors.
when the moon glows on your face,
the darkness around me flees,
for we go to our special place,
it wimpers and begs, cries and pleads.
when sunlight glimmers on your face,
my eyes become heavy with tear,
for we go to our special place,
where we can have no fear.
for you, my love, are with me,
when love shines from your face,
i love you forever, just you and me,
for we go to our special place.

he admires you
when you are not there
he praises you
with all sweet words
he decorates you
with flowers of soul
and you become
the beauty queen
of this planet.

he is unhappy
and gets sick
as if you are

the softness of your lips
as they slide over mine
taste like honey to my soul
as they take me back in time
oh the fire of your touch
like hot silk on my tender breasts
the passion i crave so much
as you taste the nectar of my kiss
a slowly drumming melody in my heart
your skin like a river of light
my moan of pleasure as you start
ecstasy i'd never fight
a lovers tune dances up my spine
as the shadow of your embrace
slides across my thighs
ohhh sooo slowly the pace
our hearts mingled in rapture
the torture of passion so sweet
the affection of a thousand years
as at least we meet
the motion of our rhythm
in perfect unison we move
our flight those of doves
as we reach heaven's hymen

a touch, soft and tender.
a whisper, full of desire
a gasp of sweet surrender
as passion fuels the fire
no words spoken between them
no promises to be kept
no lies being told tonight
no looking back - no regrets
longing to hold each other
such precious little time
both vowed to another
being lonely their only crime
tomorrow bringing sorrow
a brief moment of shame
with the memory of this one night
a release from passion's flames

perfection in my eyes
all i ever wanted was to be part of your heart,
and for us to be together, to never be apart.

you're perfect and so is this love that we share.
we have so much more than i ever thought we would,
i love you more than i ever thought i could.
i promise to give you all i have to give,
i'll do anything for you as long as i live.
in your eyes i see our present, our future and past,
by the way you look at me i know we will last.
i hope that one day you'll come to realize,
how perfect you are when seen through my eyes.
prayer of love
never thought there'll come a time,
i'll feel again the warmth of its shine.
you came like a rain in my mind,
still there's a reason that i should find.
there were many things i should have known,
yet my fear held its throne.
it led my heart to a place i know,
where there's no other way but to grow.
only god knows where this will go,
i could only ask for his mercy to show.
for prayers and love are all i have.
because there's no other way i know my love.
i will love you with all my heart,
to have forever - never to part.
this is a promise engrained in me,
take my hand and let it be.
i will go to the ends of the earth if that is what you need,
just say yes and let your soul take the lead.
this is a promise at the core of me,
kiss my lips and let this be.
i will wipe your tears with no questions asked,
no more will your feelings be masked.
this is a promise i make to you,
look into my eyes and follow through.
i will know how to hold you just by the look in your eye,
i will never forget - not even on the day that i die.
this is a promise of my passion for you,
smile at me and make it true.
i will support you even when i cannot support myself anymore,
i will dig deeper and find the hidden strength at my inner core.

understand this and make our lives anew.
i will love you with everything so deep inside,
and to only you - this gift i shall confide.
this is a promise so incredibly real,
kiss me my love and you shall feel.
can you imagine a romantic table set for two?
with candles flickering against the array of flowers
as their scent fills the room
the embers brightly burning in the fireplace
and the sound of the fire crackling is heard.
the finest bottle of french wine is set for you and i.
our favorite love songs
are softly playing in the background.
candles and the fireplace is our only light
a perfect setting for our
romantic evening of pure ecstasy.
our hearts both filled with passion, wanting
to blend as one, embraced and looking deeply
into one anothers eyes we caress each
others face with the gentleness of our hands.
we make a toast to our gift of love sent from above.
as we drink from each others glass with hands entwined.
softly i kiss your lips that now taste like sweet wine
and with the tip of my tongue i trace
the outline of your soft tender lips.
taking me in your strong arms you lift me and carry me
before the blazing fire and slowly lay me down as we
feel love's desire flow swiftly through our veins.
with the fire flickering on our bodies ...
our passion now becomes the heat of the night.
as we dance the dance of love in perfect rhythm,
we slowly fall into ecstasy
and our bodies melt together as one.
emotions flowing and hearts soaring,
two bodies blending in an unimaginable way ...
the most beautiful way ... the way god intended it to be
between a man and woman who love deeply.
two lovers who desire one another
for the whole eternity.
love poems index
rain fell last night...quiet, gentle rain,
that tapped against my window pane,
and called me back from troubled sleep,
to soothe a heart too numb to weep.
my loneliness was too deep and real,
and like a wound that would not heal,
it throbbed within me, and i knew
my arms were empty without you.
but as i listened to the sound
of soft rain falling on the ground,
i heard your voice, tender and clear,
call my name, and oh my dear,
i threw my window open wide,
to let the sweet rain rush inside.
it kissed my lips, my eyes, my hair,
and love, i knew that you were there.
tears that my heart could not release
fell down from heaven, bringing peace.
last night while gray clouds softly wept,
i held you in my arms and slept.

our love is that of a red rose
whose splendor rises as the sun shows its face,
whose petals expand further and richer
whispering secrets of happiness and affection.
and even though with the fall of dusk
all contentment is swept away,
and the rose's petals unite as one
reflecting any light that may endeavor to shine through,
the sun will always rise
and the rose's petals will eternally broaden
until they fully blossom into a stunning creation.
our love is that of a red rose
possessing a few imperfections
that may cause evanescent wounds,
but the internal radiance
that will everlastingly bestow healing and comfort.
red rose petal
i don't want red roses to show how you care
because i need to know if loving me is too much to bare
can you be there for me in my time of need
or are you going to abandon me out on the street?
is your love pure or is it fake?
do you enjoy watching my heart break?
these tears i'm crying are for you
and i don't know exactly what to do.
am i rose petal you tore off a rose
or am i whole with you so close?
i want it to be a whole one, can't you see
how much your love means to me.
i'm nothing without you but i want the truth
do you enjoy watching me alone in this booth?
i'm hoping i'm right and your love is true
because i don't know what i would do without you.
the red rose petal, used in large numbers, is a great romantic mood setter when sprinkled on the bed. ~ gabor timis
do you remember-
those times we shared?
the times when our lives touched;
the way we cared.
fate brought us together
for just a short while.
a brief taste of happiness
along life's mile.
you were my darling,
my friend and my lover.
i'm glad we met-
even though it's all over.
but, dear, let me ask you,
whatever you do
remember me, sometimes-
i won't forget you!
as i recall the memory of your face
my thoughts begin to peak
into many splendid rememberings
of beauty and grace unique
in you i found something special
for me its very true
i can't explain the hows and whys
but i know they are all in you
i also know for me you're the one
in spirit, body and soul
forever, whenever, wherever you be
you are the half of my whole
so bring together the two halves now
quickly, won't you my dear
the half of you and the half of me
so that we can revere
as i recall the memory of your face
of eyes and nose and lips
and gleaming smiles that so beguile
with lines i long to trace
rememberings, for now i see
till next with you i be
to hug and hold and kiss and love
my dearest and sweetest honey.
oh hold me close just one more time
your perfect touch, your lips on mine
because perfect things- they never last
we steal our moments, oh so fast.
come with me, let's run away
hide awhile and there we'll stay.
cuddle close and hold me tight
in your arms the world is right.
leaning near, you steal a kiss
my blushing cheeks tell all of this
your laugh, so sweet, as you watch me.
oh, we'll love forever...
they'll just see.
say anything but goodbye
forgive me, forgive me
sealed with a kiss
the soft autumn breeze
whispers in our ears
the weakness hits our knees
as that special moment nears.
the closer you come
the tighter you hold me
my body becomes numb
like it was always meant to be.
as you come near
there's a smile on my face
i know there is nothing to fear
when my heart begins to race.
the sounds become unheard
a feeling i've had never
you say that special word
that lasts in my heart forever.
our breathe slows down
we're now face to face
our love is renown
as our lips willingly embrace.
second time love
falling in love with you again,
calling in dreams, for one sweet kiss,
strolling along down "memory" lane,
rolling on waves of magical bliss.
evening is here, the rain has gone,
gleaming stars cluster high above,
leaving soon, for a new honeymoon,
believing in "second time love".
secrets of my heart
why does my heart still hold on to you
at every waking moment, in everything i do
why do i have to see your face all day
and if you knew, what would you say?
my heart breaks in two when i see her with you
and i think to myself, what didn't i do
i wish i could somehow turn back the time
and relive one second when you were mine.
i wish no one ever had to know
the feeling of lovesick pain from head to toe
like someone rips out your heart and tears it in two
and sit back and watch is all you can do.
in my dreams you say those words i long to hear
and when i look in your eyes, i know you're sincere
so i'll see you later, when the day is through
when i'm asleep in my bed, dreaming of you.
set me free
you mean the world to me,
and i can't get you out of my mind;
i don't really want to,
but i miss you more than anyone could ever know;
i need you here and you're not here,
but your voice sets me free.
everyday, all i feel is more for you;
i never thought it would be this strong,
but it is, and still, i like this feeling;
you're with me in my heart,
even though you're so far away;
i know you feel the same way, too.
for you, i do all i can,
but to me, it's not enough;
you say it's more than abundant,
and i feel you in my heart;
i hope so much that this is real,
i just want to hold your hand.
i hope someday that we'll be together,
but for now, i'll take what i can get;
i remember three hour phone conversations,
and in-class text messages;
it makes me smile,
you make me so sure.
you are the first, my only;
i never want to let you go;
pretzeled for hours,
never thinking of anyone else;
i look at your face, and am amazed;
you constantly set me free.
after a time, i finally realized that,
i really do love you;
and was overjoyed,
that you felt the same.
i can't wait for the next time i'm with you;
i miss you very much,
is what i'm trying to get at.
no one else could set me free like you.
you're the only one i want to kiss.
i almost can't stand to be away,
but duty keeps me here.
i want to hold your hand again,
and just be close to you, too.
it's only beginning,
and i hope it won't end;
you're part of my heart,
my soul, my world.
you set me free,
and all the time i'm grinning.
soon we'll be together again,
and soon i'll be ecstatic;
i'll feel complete once more,
and hold you in my arms;
you'll be with me,
and you'll set me free, then.
i want to be with you forever,
but right now i'm made to wait;
i think of you always,
and will never stop;
my love for you is a journey,
starting at forver, and ending at never.
and like my love for you,
this poem is never ending;
i find my self adding to it,
and i will always do so;
we will be together, my angel;
it will be true.
you do set me free,
everytime i think about you;
i can barely stand to be without you,
but in my heart i know i'm truely not;
i'm always with you,
as you're always with me.
a look from you is as blinding as the sun,
as stunning as your eyes i lose myself in.
a look from you is as pure as the clear blue sky,
as isolating and binding as the ties i'm in,
when i'm with you.
every minute i'm not around you,
i feel like i left something behind.
every time i'm not looking at you,
i feel like i am blind.
a smile from you is as electrifying as the moon,
as beautiful as the moonlight that shimmers off your skin.
a smile from you is as calming as the stars in the sky,
as cruelly wonderful as the world i'm in,
when i'm with you.
for you are the star in my life
an angel in the sky
what do i have to sacrifice?
for you, i would die.
i've tried, but i can't fly
no use, just hurting me more
you're my angel in the sky
here i am, tied to the floor.
you leave me here, standing in the rain
you leave me here, staring at the sky
you leave me here, in darkness and pain
you leave me here, all alone to die.
i'm soaked in blood of shattered dreams
i'm drenched in tears of silenced screams
looking at the stars in the sky
they're like scars, making me cry.
for you are the star in my life
you fell from the sky
what do i have to sacrifice?
for you, i die!
silent in the dark
so many words go unspoken,
as we linger here in the dark.
there is a thing or two i wish you to know,
but all the words seem to slip away,
as you tenderly wrap me in your embrace.
still i wish i could find a way to say,
i never thought dreams could come true
yet you showed me that they do,
when you came into my life.
you set my soul free,
with every kiss we share.
that from the moment i saw your face,
these feelings washed over me
like a tidal wave agaist the jagged shore.
tell me you feel the same.
tell me there is nowhere else you would rather be.
then here at this momemnt in each others arms.
so many words go unspoken
as we linger here in the dark.
trying to find a way to let the other know
how wonderful life is here together silent in the dark.
have you ever been silently in love
with someone you can never have?
so close you can touch her hand
yet, so far to feel her heart?
have you ever lived in pretense
quietly loving without any condition?
a feeling of love that's unknown
hiding it, not knowing for how long.
have you ever fallen deeply
loving the person unconditionally?
so afraid to say what you feel
acting normal, keeping things still.
have you ever been hurt unintentionally
but put on a smile, pretended to be happy?
deep inside you're in pain and suffering
but outside you're jolly and laughing.
why does holding her hand feel so right?
your heart smiles everytime she's at sight
hearing her sweet voice makes your day
hope you can hug her in a special way.
i can hear your whisper,
upon the breeze,
and see your smile,
in the sun.
i touch your kisses,
by the dew,
as the meadow lark,
sings his song.
i can smell your fragrance,
upon pedaled stems,
and the color abundance,
shows your joy.
i feel your tears,
when it rains,
i will always listen,
to how you speak to me,
upon my heart.

six silent tears
last night before went to bed
thoughts of you filled my head
though i have not cried this way in many years
onto my pillow fell six silent tears
the first was for your smile that i miss
and your tender lips i long to kiss
the second was for your angle face
and thoughts of your loving embrace
the third came as no suprise
as i thought of your beautiful eyes
the fourth came rolling
instead of my pillow, it should have been you i was holding
the fifth came for one reason alone
i felt my love for you wasn't fully shown
i really love and miss you my dear
and there just fell the sixth silent tear.
send this poem to a friend
the sun glistens on the water
making it sparkle and shine
it almost seems alive to me
this touches my heart
i hear a loon cry
all alone in the night
her song haunts me
this touches my heart
i see a rose growing in a bed of sand
struggling to survive
it seems to cry out for help to me
this touches my heart
i hold a new born baby in my arms
opening it's eyes to a strange new world
it's crying for it's mother
this touches my heart.
all of these things touch my heart
but none near as much
as when i see you smile
our meeting was more than fate.
god knew you were my soul mate.
your timing is never wrong.
now we share a bond so strong.
our time together means so much.
each moment intensifies the need to touch.
your love has reached my deepest soul.
longing for you to daily hold.
may our love and need continuously grow.
forever, love, need, passion to each show.
love poems index
i draw these sounds on parchment and hope it would reflect,
your sacredness deep within me i cherish with honor and respect.
our two souls have united, entwined in love's single embrace,
breathing in happiness and peace, playing in god's sacred space.
you are the soil of the earth in which the seed of my soul grow,
you are the mirror of my eyes in which your true reflection show.
inside you i have discovered the meaning of who i am,
through you i came to realize if i believe i could, i can.
you poured the riches of your wisdom into me, a once empty  shell,
and made me forget sadness and regret and wave to it farewell.
you are the anchor in the days i drift sad and lost away,
my own special mould that god made from human clay.
i hope these sounds i drew could even simply explain,
that you are my rainbow i see through the endless rain.
i know i am not a poet,i could not even pretend,
but i hope you know you are the essence who helped my soul to mend.
how i want to say so much
but words cannot express
the deep passionate love i have for you
your love outweighs my stress.
the many nights i dreamnt about you
the many days i wonder
the many hours i prayed to god
that our love will never wander.
the precious days we spend together
the love we have is real
i don't want to be with anyone else
this is how i truly feel.
baby you make me very happy
being with you are the happiest days of my life
but the happiest day of all
is when you make me your sweet wife.
so be my life, be my soul
be my heart with extra beats
thank you for being my special love
i finally feel complete.
steel and velvet
he loved her as steel, he loved her as velvet
and in her heart, so closely she held it,
to make her complete, was his deepest desire,
to take her inside him, to bring her his fire
she loved him as snow, she loved him as rain,
to give him her warmth, to vanquish his pain,
to make him complete was her longing desire,
to take him inside her, to bring him her fire
they loved as with joy, they loved as a dance
so deeply in love, through the endless romance.

there is no need to tell me - i know.
i know how you love me so.
it comes as no surprise,
i see it in your eyes,
there is no need to tell me - i know.
be still my heart, you love me still.
you need me still, you haunt me still.
after all the years, and all the tears
you calm my soul, you still my fears.
be still my heart, you love me still,
you dream of me still, and always will.
there is no need to tell me - i know.
i know how you love me so.
it comes as no surprise,
i see it in your eyes,
there is no need to tell me - i know.
like a thief, unexpectedly you robbed me
no more coldness within my heart
you changed it from dirty stone
into a beautiful piece of art
to passion i had no vision
but you kissed my eyes and let me see
another part of my rigid being
you so graciously set free
emotions which i found foreign,
seem to be a second language today
you taught me how to speak them
within my heart they'll stay
like a thief, unexpectedly you robbed me
stole my heart without a peep
i thank you for being so silent
my heart you shall keep.
love poems index
the days are filled with sunshine..
i can smell the sweet scent to the flowers...
some nice purple grapes on a vine...
i can stay here and pick them for hours...
i can feel the warmth of the sun on my shoulders...
it's like the warmth of a man's strong hands...
with only one wish, for him to hold her...
i close my eyes and try to see my man...
i see a face with happiness in his eyes...
i can feel the warmth of his body next to mine...
as i look up i can see some white fluffy clouds in the sky...
i want this moment to last a lifetime...
i pulled him close to my body as i kissed him...
he kissed me back with hot passionate kisses...
with heat radiating from around and within...
sounds of soft spoken whispers and wishes...
warmth is found when he covered my body like a blanket...
to let the warmth embrace of love soothe those secret places...
arms entwined in true loves embrace
he holds her close to kiss her face.
the gentle warmth of skin next to skin,
the tender feelings that wells up within.
with eyes closed, she breathes him in so fine,
this man so beautiful, so sublime.
his gentle caresses on skin so smooth,
in parallel unison their bodies move.
in slow rhythmic motion their bodies unite,
touching, caressing in the soft moonlight.
feeling the cool summer breeze as they make love,
whilst bright new stars twinkle above.
they sense the freedom, the love, the pride,
of being able to make love outside.
unseen by others in their own little spot,
surely no one else on earth could have what they've got.
no longer hiding what they truly feel,
this love of theirs they know it's for real.
hearts that have hidden feelings for so long,
now explode with love and desire so strong.
for these two they will always find,
that they are as one in heart and mind,
for to each other they are companions, lovers, and friends.
this kind of love will never end.
every time we touch
i feel as if i'm floating
your gentle kiss
will set my spirit soaring
you are all i have
everything to me
wrapped around your arms
encompassed in gaiety
feeling your heart
beating against mine
what i am feeling
now words can define
lying with you
watching the sunrise
listening to your whispers
looking in your eyes
you are all i have
everything to me
wrapped around your arms
encompassed in gaiety
you are all i need
all my dreams came true
the sun shines brighter
in different golden hues
when you smile at me
my knees get weak
i melt inside
everytime you speak
i am lost without you
i need you to go on
when i am with you
nothing seems wrong
you are all i have
everything to me
wrapped around your arms
encompassed in gaiety
you are all i need
all my dreams came true
the sun shines brighter
in different golden hues
you are all i have
all my dreams came true
sweet love of mine
i know it hasn't been long since i last saw you my dear,
but to me it feels as long as five hundred year.
i miss you to the point i am loosing all sanity,
there has to be an end to all this calamity.
i think of you every second and every breath,
for you i would stare even into the face of death.
to kiss your lips is to taste the sweetness of love,
and it brings forth feelings from the heavens above.
to look into your eyes is to gaze into the sky,
so beautiful with the stars and the heavens inside.
to see your smile is to see the divine,
this poem is for you, sweet love of mine.
times like these
times like these
seem so hard to bare.
the pains of life
surround us from every direction.
we seem to be consumed by it,
caught up in it,
until we can no longer see
how precious and dear
we are to one another.
times like these
when life seems so unfair,
and the world is set against us,
unknowing of our desperate need
to simply hold each other,
treasure each other,
and to discover
that all we have been searching for
has been carefully packaged
in the blissful union of togetherness.
times like these
are all we truly need,
to prove to ourselves
and to that cold, cruel world,
that nothing more than the unquenchable fire,
of that never-ending love
can come between us,
and infuse our very souls
into that heavenly, heavenly state of oneness;
you and i - for all eternity
and times like these...
that's all i ask of you
kiss me once again my love,
the way we kissed before,
i'll become a beauty queen
loving my romeo once more.
sing to me of purest love
those lyrics i cherish so;
sing of butterflies and doves,
answer my prayer, oh romeo.
music is the peace i've found,
it calms the stress of pain,
softly, hearts will beat as one,
when you kiss me once again.
kiss me once again my love,
~~ that's all i ask of you ~~
i long to be your helen of troy,
your juliet and your sylvia too.
have you have wondered
if, how, when and where,
you would ever find true love
and find someone who cared?
sometimes it takes a lifetime
and sometimes you never do,
but special things take a while
if they're really true.
it didn't take a lifetime,
but pain, hurt and strife
and now that i found you
i know it was all worth the time.
you love me unconditionally
so real and so true
so now i have to wonder,
how did l live without you?
you bring me joy and happiness
in everything you do
and i just want to thank you
and send all my love to you!
that time again
yes, that time has come again,
for you to board on that train,
it breaks my heart,
when we were apart,
how much pain do we have to take,
it's so unfair we deserve a break,
our time should be forever,
yet we don't have enough together,
all this pain down deep inside,
will one day be put aside,
for our love is for one another,
we will be together forever and ever.
the beauty of a woman
the beauty of a woman
is not in the clothes she wears,
the figure that she carries,
or the way she combs her hair.
the beauty of a woman
must be seen from her eyes,
because that is the doorway to her heart,
the place where love resides.
the beauty of a woman
is not a facial mole,
but true beauty in a woman
is reflected in her soul.
it is the caring she lovingly gives,
the passion that she shows.
the beauty of a woman with passing years --
only grows and grows.

the first touch
as he stood behind me
his body against mine.
his arms wrapped around me
his hands caressing me
i felt a sensation
a sensation my body has never felt.
as i felt his soft kisses and tongue
starting at the top of my ear
slowly moving down to my neck
my body melted.
as his hands wrapped around my waist
slowly to my stomach
softly to my breasts
my body tingled.
never felt so right.
a distant, hidden fantasy of him
never imagined would happen
never thought to come true
has not only filled my dreams every night
but has become real
no longer a dream
no longer a fantasy
it has become.
a reality ...
that first touch
the forbidden love
oh, tell me, tell me what could this be,
could this be love that enthralls me
not just any emotion
but confidence, affection, and devotion
miles apart days away
but this love chiseled in my heart will stay
wanting to grasp you close to me
but knowing i cant oh why does this be
caged, reaching out for you
so close and knowing you want this too
illusions of love you and me
but knowing i have to hide this, bites like a bee
yet the one thing that keeps us together
destroy us and will never untether
yet in the reserve of our alone
you hold me dear and no one is touv known
infatuation in every stroke and every kiss
when we are apart i fantasize of this
this love is too herculean to waste
so fare away yet close enough to taste
longing to be with you all the time
hungry for your heart to be one with mine
take this hand and escort me to your ocean
kiss me and fill me with your fragrant potion
one to make me winded make me week
that one takes all there life to seek
and at this age i have rescued love
you were sent from a glorified spirit above
every time i glance at your eyes so pure and blue
i lose my senses and want to be retained by you
craving to be in your arms, be held so tight
yearning praying begging with all my might
but i know this in no way will be
you and me at once for all to see
this, this, what it could be
for this is forbbiden love that captivates me.

the garden of love
i went to the garden of love
and saw what i never had seen:
a chapel was built in the midst,
where i used to play on the green.
and the gates of this chapel were shut,
and "thou shalt not", writ over the door;
so i turned to the garden of love,
that so many sweet flowers bore,
and i saw it filled with graves,
and tomb-stones where flowers should be;
and priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,
and binding with briars, my joys & desires.

the hands of time
the hands of time cannot erase
the thoughts of you and your embrace
the longing for a single kiss
your touch, your voice, i always miss
the hands of time, like the rolling sea
cannot wash away what you mean to me
my heart, my soul, i'll give to you
the greatest love i ever knew
the hands of time, that past so fast
my love for you will always last
to be together, is on my mind
this special love, is one of a kind
the hands of time, we cannot turn back
but love and devotion, you will never lack
i vow to you, you will always be
the only man in my life for me
the hands of time, will stop one day
but there is one thing to you, i'll say
if i should go before you do
i'll be there waiting, for only you.
look out on the water
see what i see.
it seperates us.
makes our two worlds
so entirely different.
we see, and smell
but the one thing we do see
is each other across the water.
but just because
our worlds are different
doesn't mean we aren't the same.
i love you,
near or far.
i wish that the water would just disappear
bringing us together.
my head starts spinning with ideas.
i wish i could be with you.
but when i look over once more,
i see her wrap her arms around you,
and kiss you softly.
i envy her.
but i realize, shes in your world.
and i am not.

the hill of love
i dream of the hill that we shared
i only then realised how much you cared,
your smiling face your warm embrace
mean the world to me.
the touch of your hand upon my face,
your true love is full of grace.
you touched my inner most feelings,
like you did from the begining.
so much love ,you opened my eyes,
and for me such a beautiful supprise,
i think im dreaming.
we walk down the hill hand in hand
and i think of flower blossoms all around.
oh my love for you is so honest and true,
just like the first morning dew.
and if dreams can come true,
my love will only be of you.
how i love you my  darling,
if i could make time stand still,
my love would be only of you and the hill.
his eyes shine through the clouds above,
it is two deep blue oceans i am thinking of.
with graceful eyelashes soft as doves,
inside them i see reflections of our love.
he runs to me with his soul open wide,
forever in my womb he will swim and hide,
for he knows that i will never leave his side,
he knows he will eternally be inside.
as he graces me with a kiss,
spilling is the light of joy from his lips,
his magic pools at my feet ,
his laughter leaps out at me,
as i lift him to dance in his bliss,
like a rose petal as sweet as his kiss,
he is a rhythm divine,
a love i thought i would never find,
the wonder of his smile blooms like a flower,
to you my dear child i'd give my last hour.
the little things
those calls from work
just to tell me that you love me
the attached little card
that came with the flowers
the little note
left in the morning on the mirror
that suddenly appears
when i step out of the shower
soft kisses on my cheek
when you think i am asleep
a how ya doin honey, how was your day?
a warm soft hug behind me
while i do the cooking
a little nibble on my neck
while i put dishes away dishes
oh its the little things i treasure
oh how they brighten up my day
making love to you brings me much pleasure.
but its the little things
that keep us together
those little things
will make me love you forever
those peaceful walks
out in the moonlight
the making up
after a small fight
the way you take me in your arms
and touch my face
those little drive to watch
the "submarines race"
how could there be love
if we just lived day by day
no special moments made
for thoughts of yesterdays
those foot massages
after a long day of work.
when im just too tired to cook
those for no reason whispers
to tell me that you care
those sly come hither looks
while youre sitting in you chair
oh its the little things i treasure
oh how they brighten up my day
making love to you brings me much pleasure.
but its the little things
that keep us together
those little things
will make me love you forever
the lord answered
when lord, i asked
will my salvation be?
in prison,  prison of mind,
enslaved and shackled
i once thought love was a mere myth,
fantasy, existing only in ones deepest hopes.
bitterness possessed me, i cried out to you
lord for a clam spirit.
i begged and waited with bated breath
but my hopes grew dim, my soul
became weary, my desires became dull.
my agony was consuming me all at once.
just as i thought i could go no lower,
suddenly in my darkness,
appeared light. and from that light
issued forth great intellect and understandings from
a divine source. that source being you, lord.
you gave me the understanding that
love was a reality that was possible
for any heart to feel and so
you sent me a precious love,
a love, which i hold so
dear to my heart.
more precious than the finest materials
in existence and of splendid value
this love of mine you sent me.
i thank you lord, for i love him so,
how i love him so?
lord, only you so know.

the love i have for you
when we are apart,
can love heal my lonely heart
when you are here,
all my fears seem to disapppear,
i love you,i really do
sleep is sweet,
when i'm dreaming of you
time spent with you,
it makes all my dreams come true
this love i have for you,
streams deeper than the ocean sea
you would never know,
just how much you mean to me
when i am with you and when you are with me,
there's no other place i'd rather be
because this love i have for you
shall last for all eternity.
the love of my life
i always dreamed of the day i'd meet the one.
the day that my romeo would sweep my away.
but i never thought it would actually be.
it was just a dream.
a fantasy so far off that would never come true.
i prayed that you would come.
that god would send the only one that i'd ever need.
the only one that would ever make me feel special.
so i waited.
i waited with hope.
hope that i'd be given the gift to love and to be loved.
and then that day in sweet november.
oh, that day i'll never forget.
it was when all my hopes, dreams, and prayers came true.
the day when you left your guys to be with me.
why me? i had to ask myself.
then i realized you were the one.
the one who would encourage me, charish me, and love me till the end.
you just can't imagine the way you make me feel.
it's a feeling i just can't explain.
the feeling i get whenever i look at you,
hear your name,  or feel the slightest touch of your hand.
i love the way you look at me, and the way you make me smile.
i especially love the way you place your hands around my waist and softly
tickle until i get chills.
i just wonder if your hands could feel the butterflies i get while they
and i can't forget your gentle kiss.
your lips softly kissing my back.
i wanted that moment to last forever.
and your brown eyes.
looking in them i get lost in my thoughts.
it all seems so perfect.
i can't wait until we finally belong to each other.
the day we both say "i do".
and the gift that we will exchange.
the gift we've saved our whole lives to give that special one.
so forever you will be my one and only.
the one and only love of my life.

the magic of love
the magic of love, oh how inviting,
amorous love ~ is a flame so exciting,
infatuation, the romance of a kiss,
two arms enfold you, heavenly bliss!
as you grow old, you'll remember this.
the way it feels to be head over heels
obsessed, beguiled, spinning on wheels.
mania, passion, call it what you will
but cupid's arrow reaches over the hill.
as you grow old, you'll remember still.
lips on the small of a back
making their way on a charted course.
kisses on the thigh,
in pursuit of torrid pleasure.
hands searching for perfection and
feeling their way down heavenly skin.
eyes gazed in marvel
at the illusory of circumstance,
toward a destiny unknown.
gasps of breath,
the sense of oneness never this powerful,
felt to the bone.
the assured nature of every touch and
the warmth of flesh on flesh.
on top of disbelief.
the rush of heat to the soul and
life in a dead heart.
you are the only one for me,
and i am always yours to be.
when you look my way and smile
i know that i am loved
for it burns deep into my soul.
i will be at your side always
no matter where you are
no matter how far you go
you will have my shoulder to lay your head upon.
you are my life,
you are my happiness
you are entwined deep within my heart and soul.
i can feel your presence when i close my eyes,
for youre my angel that keeps my heart alive.
you are the one that i truly love
and there will never be another.
the passionate shepherd to his love
come live with me and be my love,
and we will all the pleasures prove,
that valleys, groves, hills and fields,
woods or steepy mountains yields.
and we will sit upon the rocks,
seeing the shepherds feed their flocks
by shallow rivers, to whose falls
melodious birds sing madrigals.
and i will make thee beds of roses,
and a thousand fragrant posies,
a cap of flowers and a kirtle
embroidered all with leaves of myrtle;
a gown made of the finest wool,
which from our pretty lambs we pull;
fair-lined slippers for the cold,
with buckles of the purest gold;
a belt of straw and ivy buds,
with coral clasps and amber studs;
and if these pleasures may thee move,
come live with me and be my love.
the shepherd swains shall dance and sing
for thy delight each may morning;
if these delights thy mind may move,
then live with me and be my love.
the picture in my dreams
late at night when i'm in bed
what seems like a picture begins in my head.
and as my eyes begin to shut,
my body feels as it is fluttering up.
then as amazing as it seems,
the picture becomes clearer and clearer in my dreams.
but what does the picture hold?
i still can't make it out.
but as it begins to unfold,
i know there is no doubt.
it's a picture of a man and a woman standing side by side,
with happiness in their eyes.
but suddenly the picture comes to a stop.
then the man looks like me,
the woman i still can't make out.
but how can this be?
everything was going right and i was going to see
the woman i loved and was going to be with for eternity.
the picture isn't coming out and i guess i will have to wait and see
to find out who the woman is standing next to me.
for maybe we might get together and i hope this dream comes true.
but now i know i won't have to wait for her;
because the woman in my arms is you.
there is a lady sweet and kind
there is a lady sweet and kind,
was never a face so pleased my mind;
i did but see her passing by,
and yet, i'll love her till i die.
her gesture, motion, and her smiles,
her wit, her voice my heart beguiles,
beguiles my heart, i know not why,
and yet, i'll love her till i die.
cupid is winged and he doth range,
her country, so, my love doth change;
but change she earth, or change she sky,
yet, i will love her till i die.

the pencil on the table
your face is in my mind
the way youre looking to me
gave birth to the dead inside
yet the pencil is silent
there is only the will
to draw the curves of your face
to feel your skin.
i saw you in my dreams.
it was so clear and pure.
and here you shine again.
the only dream i had
is the one i shared with you.
the others i forgot,
the wind tarred them apart
and the dream lifted me up
waked the artist inside.
the pencil kissed the paper
so tender and so sweet
gave birth to those purest
stars anyone will ever meet.
so charming and so warm
the pearls were dropping down
giving life to those flowers,
blossoming all around.
and on the paper it carved
the traces of your soul,
the wonders of your sorrow
the sweetness of your faith.
the pencil left the paper
yet there is more to draw
no one should ever see it
but in our hearts we know
and on the edge of darkness
it was cold beside you
it was ever dead, yet
it lived for seeing you.
and on the paper its soul
was poured, beneath your tears.
yet on the paper it died,
long time ago.
i wake and wipe the sleep from my eyes
through blurred vision i see your silhouette
standing in the open balcony doorway
soft tufts of hair bouncing in the breeze
morning sunlight glimmers
off the bulge of your chest
casting even larger shadows
on the bedroom floor.
i stretch and rise, and sitting tall in my bed
feeling the gentle morning breeze caress my face
while songbirds sing their morning serenade
your scent fills my senses
oh how it lights my soul with desire
how i long for you to hold me
how i need to feel your touch
how i need to hear your voice calling out my name
while gentle arms hold me close to your beating heart
i step from my bed
and turn to face the world
anticipating the delight
of yet another glimpse of your form
but the door stands vacant
curtains blowing soft and free in the breeze
how empty is my heart, how lonely is my soul
for these shadows, these illusions of you
now swept away without a sound
are those i hold only in memory
gathered long before you and i did part
lost forever except deep within my heart.
the simple things
how is it that each and everytime
my life seems on the verge of break down,
you make everything better with the simple things
and put a smile on my face without a sound?
not even all the riches of the world
would help me make it through a day,
but just a minute spent with you
and my whole world seems okay.
a gaze of your heavenly brown eyes,
a whisper from your enticing lips,
the caress of your comforting hug,
and a taste of your sweet kiss.
all those things helps me through one more day
and makes my life seem worth while.
when you hold me tight in your arms,
i feel safe, as a newborn child
i was torn between what was and what could be,
like my heart was clinging on to the past.
he had shattered my heart in a million pieces,
but because of you the pain didn`t last.
as you come to me with a casual flow,
i get chills down to the bone.
you capture all of my attention,
as you talk with that sexual tone.
when you run your fingers slowly over me,
i lose all of my self control.
right or not, for a moment all of me belongs to you:
mind, body, and soul
the things i do
sometime i can ask is our love true,
or is it the things i do.
the thought of you
the thought of you starts me trembling
a fire is raging deep inside my heart
i can still feel your body close to mine
the way you held me so tenderly
i still taste your kisses on my lips
alone, i hunger for those kisses tonight
my mind recalls the words you spoke
the way your hands explored my body
the time spent with you passed quickly
but your loving has left a burning fire
a fire that only your love can put out and
i wait for your return with open arms.

the sorrow of love
the quarrel of the sparrow in the eaves,
the full round moon and the star-laden sky,
and the loud song of the ever-singing leaves,
had hid away earth's old and weary cry.
and then you came with those red mournful lips,
and with you came the whole of the world's tears,
and all the sorrows of her labouring ships,
and all the burden of her myriad years.
and now the sparrows warring in the eaves,
the curd-pale moon, the white stars in the sky,
and the loud chaunting of the unquiet leaves,
are shaken with earth's old and weary cry.
the way you make me feel
you make me feel special,
you make me feel new,
you make me feel loved,
with everything you do.
you hold me close when i am sad.
you wipe the tears from my face.
every time we are together,
it seems like the perfect place.
my eyes light up when you enter a room.
i smile when we are together.
no matter how bad things are,
you always make them better.
i love the way you kiss me,
the way you hold me tight.
i love the way you touch me,
i could be with you all night.
i love the way you can make me laugh
for absolutely no reason at all.
i love how no matter what i do,
you will be there to catch me when i fall.
i just want you to know,
that even though we sometimes fight,
i will always love you!
no matter what, day or night.
thinking of you
the sun is setting on a lonely day
the colours are splitting, the perfect way
your strolling home as you see this too
and i watch from a window thinking of you
from this day on, ill look forever
that magical sunset, our memories together
to help me through when my life gets tough
and when i feel that ive had enough
the sun you see, makes me think of you
the miracle of it, the wonder too
i see you both everyday as you know
to stop seeing either, id have to say, no
the bright colours shine from within my heart
the colours of a sunset, a special part
of a day in my life i wish you could see
just whats its like, just to be me.
this is for you
let me lie in your arms tonight
so you can love me for the rest of our lives
let you brighten the way with your eyes
and keep this love we share alive.
let me feel the tenderness of you heart
with the hope that we will never be apart
baby, it was magical from the start
cuz we are this painting of art.
this is for you
all my emotion inside
love that will never die.
this is for you
can't put it in words
you are my world
this is for you.
let me see how much you care
the love with me you want to share
splitting with you i cannot bare
taking that road i will not dare.
let me know what i mean to you
cuz i believe that our love is true
hope that you feel the same way to
and loving you is all i want to do.
just give me your heart
and i'll hold it tight
all of your love
i'll make it all right.
our love is like this porcelain rose -
fragile, yet unable to be broken.
this rose, like our love,
will never die.
the dew kissed petals represent
the tears we've cried.
it often says the words of affection
that sometimes go unspoken.
please do not leave our love on the shelf,
with me, you do not have to be afraid to be yourself.
as our life together begins,
i want you to hold the porcelain rose close to your heart.
and remember our love is too strong to be torn apart.

this promise is solid,
and these words i speak are true,
i want you to know i love you,
and will always be there for you.
life for me has been funny,
throwing me twists and turns.
never knowing what to expect,
from around that next curve.
when you came into my life,
that road started to straighten out,
things became more normal.
and i knew without a doubt.
you were the one for me,
making my life full of love,
my heart full of joy,
its like we fit like a glove.
the lucky man i am,
to have found you by chance,
you made everything feel better,
with just your smile and glance.
thank you for everything,
helping me find that true road,
im hoping you will join me,
as lifes treasures unfold.
can you tell me
what's on your mind
cause i feel as though
i finally got it right, this time
before you i thought i was whole
but not it feels like
im losing control
i feel that this is true
cause all i want to do
is spend more time with you
so can you tell me
what's on your mind
cause i feel as though
i finally got it right, this time.
thoughts of you
i was thinking about you today
and i do that a lot it seems.
you're always in my heart by day,
at night you drift into my dreams.
i cannot shake these feelings for you,
but then i'd never had a desire to.
the blessing of our love and friendship,
is something i want to share with you.
i want to feel you near me,
when you're so far away.
i hope you feel me in your heart,
as you travel your path today.
footprints in the sands of time,
walking closer towards each other.
holding hands and sharing love,
which will not be meant for another.
these are some of the memories,
that come with thoughts of you.
these feelings are from my very heart,
and something you can hold as true.
to a long-loved love
we, who have seen the new moon grow old together,
who have seen winter rime the fields and stones
as though it would claim earth and water forever,
we who have known the touch of flesh and the shape of bones
know the old moon stretching its shadows across a whitened field
more beautiful than spring with all its spate of blooms;
what passion knowledge of tried flesh still yields,
what joy and comfort these familiar rooms.
in the moonless, lampless dark now of this bed
my body knows each line and curve of yours;
my fingers know the shape of limb and head:
as pure as mathematics ecstasy endures.
blinded by night and love we share our passion,
certain of burning flesh, of living bone:
so feels the sculptor in the moment of creation
moving his hands across the uncut stone.
i know why a star gives light
shining quietly in the night;
arithmetic helps me unravel
the hours and years this light must travel
to penetrate our atmosphere.
i can count the craters on the moon
with telescopes to make them clear.
with delicate instruments i can measure
the secrets of barometric pressure.
and therefore i find it inexpressibly queer
that with my own soul i am out of tune,
and that i have not stumbled on the art
of forecasting the weather of the heart.
to give back to you
to give back to you
what you've given to me
would take me nearly an eternity
through all the special time we've shared
you have taught me to love, learn, and care
through all the hard times we've been through
helps to prove our love is true
to give back to you
what you've given to me
would take me nearly an eternity
but if that's what it takes
it's what i'll do
to prove the love
that i feel for you
to someone special
old memories are coming back to me
they're making me feel truly happy
each little memory i treasure dearly
for they are about you,
a person i cherish ever so deeply.
in my sleepless solitude tonight,
i can't seem to keep you off my mind
i want to hug you with all my might
oh, what i'd give just to have you
here with me through the night
if it's wrong to love you,
then i just don't want to be right.
life is much better with you around
to my ear, your name is such a sweet sound
i was confused until you, i found
you lifted me up high from the ground.
my world was so lonely without you,
i haven't noticed the sky's shade of blue.
everything seemed ordinary before you
but now that you're here,
i see the world in a nice different view
and now, all i want to say is thank you
to the one i love
from the very day we met
it seems i never could forget.
the wonders of your loving heart
the feeling that we'll never part.
i think about you all the time.
and cant believe youre actually mine.
the love i have for you is real.
and as i say this i start to kneel.
i take your hand and squeeze it tight
and look into your loving eyes.
now i have figured out
that you, are my greatest prize.
i want to say i love you
but really don't know how
the only time i've felt this way
is right here and now.
now the time has come at last
i hope it doesn't go by too fast
you have filled the void in my heart
and i really don't know where to start.
i guess i'll just have to come out and say
that i love you more each night and day
you're love for me is all i need
and more than i can stand
i hope that you will take my hand
as i slip on your finger, this little band
it has no beginning, and it has no end
just like my love for you, my very best friend
now i have to take a chance
and tell you after all this romance
i want you always by my side
and so i ask you to be my bride.
when tomorrow starts without me
and i'm not here to see
if the sun should rise and find you eyes
all filled with tears for me
i wish so much you wouldn't cry
the way you did today
while thinking of the many things
we didnt get to say
i know how  much you love me
as much as i love you
and each time that you think of me
i know you'll miss me too
but when tomorrow starts without me
please try to understand
that an angel came and called my name
and took me by the hand
and said my place was ready in heaven far above
and that i'd have to leave behind
all those i dearly love
but when i walked through heaven's gates
i felt so much at home when
god looked down and smiled at me
from his great golden throne he said
"this is eternity and all i've promised you"
today for life on earth is past
but here it starts a new
i promise no tomorrow
for today will always last
and since each day's the same way
there's no longing for the past
so when tomorrow starts without me
don't think we're far apart
for every time you think of me
i'm right here in your heart
to my soulmate
you are my fire
my titanic ocean
your love burns
right through my
your love can purify me
make me whole.
the wind of nature
is like your love
it's like no other
i've been thinking of
it encircles me
breathing upon my heart
that i may inherit it's
and i hear you say
"come, fill this vacuum
that your love
cease this emptiness
that fills my soul
only your love
can save me
give me life
make me whole".
please speak to
my heart today
encourage my love
please don't delay.
clear the vagueness
which impedes me
come enlighten my
mind, body and soul
and the truth will only
to the love that makes
to the love of my life
i could tell you i loved you.
i could tell you you're my life.
but i won't because i don't think that would be enough.
not only do i want to tell you how much i love you,
i want to show you.
you are the reason i live,
the reason my heart keeps beating.
without you my life would be over.
i never knew i could love someone as much as i love and need you.
please know i'll never be able to love anyone as much as i love you.
you're the only one for me.
and that's the way it will always be.
without you my heart would be empty and incomplete.
every memory i have of you i treasure.
every thought of you is wonderful.
thank you for the love you have given me.
thank you for the lesson of my life i will never forget.
thank you, love of my life.
it's so good to be loved
to be essential to someone
to be the breath of their life
the beat in their heart
the fire in their blood
seeing love in their eyes
knowing you are the one
being in their every thought
it's so good to be loved
except when you love another.

love comes through the eyes
that help me see this wonderful surprise
i see this wonderful man
whom of which i can always stand
love comes through the ears
that never hear fears
they help me hear the words from you
and help me pull through
love comes through the hands
that make you my man
your touch creates chills
which make me go through many thrills
love comes through the mouth
that will one day make you my spouse
you say the right things at the right time
which help me keep my state of mind
love comes through dreams
that make us gleam
i dream about life with you in it
and everything seems lit
love comes through smiles
that extend for miles
you can see all the joy
that comes from my baby boy
love comes through affection
that makes me feel your protection
i feel safe and secure
and always come back for more
love comes through the seasons
that give me plenty of reasons
reasons that i love you
and make us true
love comes through the heart
that makes me want to never part
your heart is all i need to get by
without making me cry
love comes through me
which will set you free
i will give you all my love
that was sent as a gift from above
love comes through you
that is always new
you come up with the sweetest things
and i know we can handle whatever love brings
love comes through each one of us
that makes us a must
i don't think i'd make it without you
and your love so very true.
a gentle brush of his fingers threw my hair,
sending shivers down my spine that i can't compare.
in the love i see in his eyes,
is a love that equals mine.
he greets me with a smile that unforgettable,
and leaves me with a kiss that melts my heart.
if he were to ever leave me,
i couldn't imagine what i'd miss.
maybe it's his touch,
or the way that we kiss.
but whatever it is,
i'm head over heels,
and only true loves can feel this.
true loves gift
there was once a time my heart was stone,
nothing could get by the walls that i made
crying myself to sleep on each cold night,
my soul filled up with sadness, pain and fright.
i could see no hope for me in my life,
no joy, no happiness, just an empty shell,
nothing had meaning, no peace just war,
i wanted to give up, i wanted no more.
then all of a sudden you came into my life
all of my fears disappeared with your smile
when you looked into my eyes, i found peace
my heart filled with joy, all my pain did cease.
many men have seen angels but i have seen you,
youre more beautiful than all the stars combined,
my hearts not cold anymore, the stone has crumbled away
my life began again on this wonderful, bright day.
i walk with a smile, a spring in my step
a song in my heart, a light in my soul
i am happy now, you've changed my life for good
im flying in the clouds, reach the stars i could.
you are my fantasy, my reality and everything in between
i feel alive for the first time ever, i feel so much
emotions deeper than ever before, passion so intense
everything seems so clear, but yet nothing seems to make sense.
when you hold me close in your arms,
the world just melts away around me,
there is nowhere else i'd rather be,
looking deep in your eyes, my heart at last is free.
before i met you i knew only darkness,
now i see nothing but light,
my heart is flying over mountain and hill
i love you forever, and i always will.
true love awaits you
eyes that are crystal clear,
one thinks he could see forever.
but within you lies uncertainty and confusion,
like boulders in a raging river.
the swift current, the choppy waters,
this makes for a rough and tumble ride.
be brave, be true to yourself,
with me there is nothing to hide.
conquer the rapids, guide this craft,
don't sail this adventure short.
at journey's end, where the water calms,
could lie a safe and wondrous port.
so, it's through great canyons, on to the ocean,
let us greet the unknown.
paddle fast, my love, get to my heart,
for it is there you might find your own.

understanding of love
love is sweet, love is kind
it isn't just a piece of mind
love is something you need to give
something that we share and believe
love doesn't mind you
to cry a tear or two
but true love isn't sad
it's never bad.
love is unique
something like an antique
when it's broken
it seems to be forsaken
but then someone comes and see the gold
all that's scattered now is whole to hold.
what is love, you ask
well, it's something that can never be fully described
it's different to everyone
and it's really up to you to decide.
love is powerful yet can be weak
something that everyone seems to seek
love is mindful and understanding
when everything falls
it'll be the last one standing
though it seems like a small matter
never judge emotion by its size
understand what love is
you'll see what a world there is.
villonet on love
tranquil and calm as music of the sea,
you are handsome for sure, very mature
closer closer, i am drawn each new day
in the hope that our love will sweeter be.
we fell in love 'neath the sycamore tree
wait for awhile; you'll recall with a smile.
each whispering caress was always true,
tranquil and calm as music of the sea.
love's symphony echoed across the lea
foliage floated down in shades of gold
i now write poems with delicate air...
in the hope that our love will sweeter be.
tranquil and calm as music of the sea
we will dance to the moonlight serenade
in the hope that our love will sweeter be.

there was only one love in my life,
only you brought me sweet paradise.
there was only one rapturous kiss,
the tempting kiss i could never resist!
only one love in my life.
it was you.
there was only one glistening moon,
that led the way to the altar in june,
and only one star-spangled night,

waltz of the mountains
the dream ever lingers,
and it's heaven you see.
my spirit flies over blue
mountains to thee;
i hear your voice calling
with a magic enthralling,
so in love i am falling
as you dance the last
waltz of the mountains

hot burning pain
and features that i want to break
stay too close
"me and you"
no one says that anymore
fires come back
i can't leave you!
i can't see my life
if you aren't there to cling to and to love
salute to fallen men
but forget me
it seems you don't believe in love
that's so hollow!
you don't cry - i do that for you
i cry enough tears to fill the empty space
that you constantly keep between us!
we must cling together
if your loving is true
skies above will stay blue;
walk with me till the end
when the angels descend.
keep your kisses in tune
with the dreamy old moon,
let your bright spanish eyes
cast spells of paradise.
i need only your love;
it's just you i dream of,
in your arma i nestle
to me, this is special.
whatever will i do
if you turn from my view?
we must cling together
a lover's endeavour.
can you hear words i say
with your mind faraway?
for your answer i pray.
"have a wonderful day".
well, i can dream!
winsome, when at his best,
so suave in evening dress.
is it any wonder i fell right
under his awesome spell?
a supernatural man from afar,
i love him well, my superstar.
skies fall at my feet as we meet,
archangels listen as we speak.
he's a "one-woman guy" and as
time goes by, i wonder why we
are so in love ~ o me, o my!
isn't life pleasantly sweet?
a beautiful love song i hear.
a top of the run, number one;
we're going dancing in the vale;
i am under his spell, because
he's a superhuman-supernatural
one in a million superstar.

what can i say?
what can i say to the one who owns my heart,
my body, my very soul?
what can i say to the one that i
could never imagine life without?
what can i say to the one who
has been there for me all along,
the one who encouraged me go on
when i was so ready to give up?
what can i say to the one who
understands me more than i understand myself,
who shares my every pain?
what can i say to this man i adore?
when i am in your arms,
feeling the warmth of your body next to mine,
i find no words, only the beating of two hearts in love.
two hearts joined together forever..i love you.

what christmas means to me
you're like christmas at home by the tree
a special present wrapped all up for me
only each day theres a new surprise
its always you...i cant believe my eyes
you're the loving words in a christmas card
you're the christmas spirt when things get hard
you're the bright lights on the house when things were dim
you're the shiny new ornament on a trees sturdy limb
you're the joy of the holiday season
you're why i wrote this for no reason
you're the feeling of giving and receiving
you're why its still worth believing
thats why you're the angel placed way above
why you're the one with all my love.
what i feel
we've grown close over time
now i wish you were mine
when i'm with you
i never feel blue
with kisses so gentle and touches so warm
with enduring hugs i shall never feel harm
words can't express what i feel
so i guess what i'm asking is what's the deal?
you make me laugh you make me smile
i am willing to go that extra mile
what i love about you
i love the way you look at me
your eyes so bright and blue,
i love the way you kiss me
your lips so soft and smooth
i love the way you make me happy
and the ways you show you care,
i love the way you say "i love you"
and the way you're always there
i love the way you touch me
always chills down my spine,
i love that you are with me
and i'm glad you are mine.

love is a thing shared by two
love is what you feel for me and you
love is precious when its shared
love is danger when its dared
love wanders and searches for the one
love plays and just do it for fun
love lets you hear love songs to emote
love lets you make sweet poems & a quote
love makes the world go around
love makes us happy if the one we love
is finally found
love turns the world upside down
love cheers us never with a frown
love makes you cry
love sacrifices and says goodbye
love has its own reason and time
love can make someone you love "mine"
love makes a person kiss
love makes a person miss
love is experienced by all
love conquers when you fall
what is love ?
a longing after more than outward pleasure,
a digging to discover hidden treasure.
an aesop's net, where mouselike you may see
a nibbling coney set a lion free.
the pleasant'st game that ever was invented.
the sweetest sin, so hard to be repented,
that makes the lawyer plead without a fee
and the divine commit idolatry;
that makes the daring soldier to prefer
a single combat far before the war;
turns age to youth, that once again they might
in august taste of pleasant may's delight.
what is it about you?
what is it about you  that i'm so attracted to?
is it the tender look in your eyes?
or your lips so soft and kissable?
is it the way you call me baby?
or the sweetness in you, which makes you so lovable?
what's there in you  that i've never felt before?
is it your touch  or your warm embrace?
is it the way you hold me  or your silky caress?
or that every time your lips meet mine,
there's a sincere, special look in your face.
what is it about you  that makes me miss you so?
is it that i can't imagine me without you?
or that not hearing the sound of your voice,
always makes me miss you more  makes me so blue.
what is it about you  that makes me long for more?
is it your confident, yet kind and gentle way?
is it that when we cuddle, my heart you always touch?
or the way i urge to be with you night and day.
what is it about you  that frightens me so?
is it that you may not feel exactly what i feel?
is it that there's still a wall setting us apart?
or that you're so afraid of opening your heart.
i have yet to find the answers,
to the questions which here lay.
all i know is when i'm with you,
all my worries fade away.

what you are to me
you're the sun that warms my face
you're the winds that embrace
you're the calmness the ocean sound brings
you're the beauty of flowers in the spring.
you've given me hope when i didn't have any
you've given me forgiveness that i didn't deserve
you've given me more than i could ever ask for
you've even given me love when i didn't love you in return.
you are my very best friend
you are my soul mate to the end
you are the love of my heart
i know we will never part.
so if you ever need me
know that i'll be there
i want to love you the way you have loved me
i want you to know how much i care.
no matter where i go or what i do
i'll spend the rest of my life
showing how much i love you.
whenever he is there
an inner peace surrounds me,
contentment in my heart.
a love that i have longed for,
right from the very start.
the serenity i feel inside,
the longing for his touch.
his warm and gentle kisses,
oh, they mean so very much.
an inner strength inside me,
one ive never felt before.
so thankful for what im feeling,
right now and ever more.
not a day goes by that i dont learn,
what love is all about.
holding on to what is special.
never giving in to doubt.
these feelings i hold deep inside,
and the love i have to share.
pour from my heart so freely,
whenever he is there.
when i see your smile once more
i will know you are here,
for my eyes would have seen
when i touch your hand once more
i will know it is true,
and no longer a dream
when i hold you close once more
i will know you have come,
to be here with me
when i kiss you softly once more
you will know that our love
was destined to be.

when i sleep
when the dawn turns to dusk,
my world suddenly feels right all over again,
for i know when i close my eyes,
when the gaze of my eyes meets yours
when the gaze of my eyes meets yours,
my heart starts bleeding and my eyes start weeping,
for in it i see an emptiness,
only a reflection of me look at you,
when the gaze of my eyes meet yours,
the pains and sorrows of the world i feel,
like a mother losing a child would,
i feel it when i look at you,
when the gaze of my eyes meets yours,
i let myself go into the memories of the past,
i cloud the reality of my life,
and live that moment as we were before,
when the gaze of my eyes meets yours,
i feel both joy and sorrow,
both the past and the present,
and yet tomorrow is what i have,
when the gaze of my eyes meets yours,
when we kiss
do you like the way that we kiss?
the fullness of my pastel pink lips
the soft texture created with the help of chapstick
the pause of anticipated excitement
when our eyes lock and time skips
the closeness of intimate contact
the public display
the aftershocks of being kissed this way
the unscripted synchrony in which our heads turn
the slight touching of tongues
our chests pressed together
feeling the inhale and exhale of expanding lungs
the sense of soul seduction
the blood rushing
the trust involved in lip phuckin
the sounds made as i capture
your bottom lip for gentle sucking
so...do you like the way that we kiss
or shall we try this again?
comparing notes of oral pleasures
for kissing never felt this good
when you're in love
when you're in love,
it's like springtime,
when you're in love
the birds sing...
when you're in love
it is ring time
in your mind
love is everything.
when you're in love
it is waltztime,
dancing on air in the blue,
and it's a wonderful day
when you are going away
on a honeymoon cruise
just for two.
where are you hiding?
where are you hiding my dearest,
is this the end of a beautiful song?
i have searched for you in the valley
and the hillocks that lie beyond.
i have prayed by the tidal waters,
i've scanned the heath and the moor,
but the man of my dreams is missing,
o come ye back ~ i do implore.
thou art the dear one i hope will be
turning the key to love's allure,
but my body is tired and weary now,
i can search the byways no more.
where are you hiding my dearest,
is this the end of a beautiful song?

while you are away
i can't be with you today
but if you close your eyes and think;
i'll be beside you in the kitchen
wearing your shirt - standing by the sink.
i'll be with you in the bedroom
waiting quietly on your bed;
just close your eyes and think of me,
relive those memories in your head.
i'll stand by you in the bathroom,
an unlikely place to meet;
i'll smile at you so playfully
as i let you brush my teeth.
i'll be your light in the darkness,
shining steady through and through;
you only have to watch it glow
to know i think of you.
i'll be the music that you listen to,
i'll be there in every song:
i'll laugh with you and sing with you,
and comfort you when your day's gone wrong.
i'll be the wind that ruffles your hair,
i'll be that warm embrace;
i'll be the hand on your shoulder,
i'll be the tender touch on your face.
i'll be the clock gently ticking,
reminding you of the times;
we've shut the rest of the world outside
we're in our own world - yours and mine.
i'll be the moon as it dances
on the water cold and still;
for i have loved you always
and i know i always will.
though you may not see me physically
as you live your life today;
just close your eyes and think of me
i will not be far away.
i thought you said you loved me, but it was whispers on the wind ...
and sometimes when it's late at night, i hear those words again.
and when the rain is falling, so softly as a mist ...
i hear a sound that whispers, a sound just like a kiss.
when the moon is shining full, and it shows me where to walk...
i hear the wind flow through the trees, i remember how we talked.
with faces close, and hands held tight, no words were needed then ...
between our hearts, our love would pass, like whispers on the wind.
i thought i felt you love me, like it would never end.
why do i cry ?
sometimes we argue, i don't know why.
then i sit and wonder, why do i cry?
i cry because i love you,
i cry because i care,
i cry because i feel we have a love so rare,
sometimes i'm afraid i'll turn around and you won't be there.
i love you every minute,
i love you every day,
i even love you when we argue,
i love you when we play.
sometimes i've wondered do you love me too,
then i look in your eyes and
i know it's true.
so when i say something a little crazy
or i do something you don't feel is right,
please, let's try to work it out so we won't fight.
some people take relationships for granted
it's sad to hear but true,
i don't want this to happen, not with you.
i want our relationship to be completely from the heart
so we both know, no matter what we go through we will never part.
why do i have to cry?
when in spring the flowers bloom,
and everything is born anew,
why do i have to cry?
i could be sharing this beauty with you...
why, oh why do i have to sigh?
when the sun in the summer noon,
shines so brightly upon the land,
why do i have to cry?
i could be holding you by the hand...
why, oh why do i have to sigh?
winds blow tenderly in autumn,
and the leaves so gently fall,
why do i have to cry?
i know we could have had it all...
why, oh why do i have to sigh?
cold outside in winter evenings,
colder here within my heart,
why do i have to cry?
i never wanted us to be appart...
why, oh why do i have to sigh?
why do i love you?
you make me smile
when i'm having a bad day.
you make me laugh
at everything you say.
you're always there
no matter where you are.
you come rushing towards me
even if you're very far.
you enjoy my company
you smile when you see me.
you're interested in what i have to say
you like me for more than what you see.
when i'm afraid
you're there to hold me tight.
you tell me you love me
and that everything is gonna be alright.
you give me so much more
that i could ever give.
i want you in my life forever
for as long as i live.
why i love you
the perfect girl used to be only in dreams it seems,
but when i first saw you, it changed everything.
i knew right off that you were the one,
will you ?
will you listen to me as the rain beats down?
will you smile at me as the the sun hits the ground?
will you laugh at my jokes whatever they may be?
will you remember my love for eternity?
will you build me up as my world falls apart?
will you understand these words came from the bottom of my heart?
will you kiss me tenderly each and every day?
will you tell me you love me, never with dismay?
will you save me from evil, protect me from pain?
will you show me happiness, and ill do the same?
will you promise me that you will never let me go?
will you show me a place we can always call home?
will you stand by my grave when i am gone?
will you lay down red roses, with a sweat peaceful song?
will you have me in your heart and keep my love true and...
will you please remember that i will always love you?
if i will only let
this moment pass away
the chance to have you
will fly and will not stay.
where will i be now?
if you won't be here
will you let this tears
wash the happiness
of the past?
will you still love me
if i tell you
that i will love you
more than you do?
will you hate me
if i wont ever let you go
it's so hard
please tell me will you?
wind and window flower
lovers, forget your love,
and listen to the love of these,
she a window flower,
and he a winter breeze.
when the frosty window veil
was melted down at noon,
and the caged yellow bird
hung over her in tune,
he marked her through the pane,
he could not help but mark,
and only passed her by
to come again at dark.
he was a winter wind,
concerned with ice and snow,
dead weeds and unmated birds,
and little of love could know.
but he sighed upon the sill,
he gave the sash a shake,
as witness all within
who lay that night awake.
per chance he half prevailed
to win her for the flight
from the firelit looking-glass
and warm stove-window light.
but the flower leaned aside
and thought of naught to say,
and morning found the breeze
a hundred miles away.
with these eyes
with these eyes, i see thee,
with these hands, i feel thee,
with these looks, i give thee,
with these pictures, i save thee.
with these lips, i kiss thee,
with these fingers, i touch thee,
with these words, i speak to thee,
with these ears, i hear thee.
with these feet, i walk to thee,
with these feelings, i show thee,
with these conversations, i know thee,
with these tears, i miss thee.
with these vows, i promise thee,
with these holds, i love thee,
with these emotions, i long for thee,
with these dreams, i tell thee.
with these memories, i keep thee.
within a heart
within a lonely heart there dwells
a soul of untold dreams
within a heart of love there dwells
a dreamer, so it seems
so what, per chance, resides
among the dreams left there to die?
a heart long since forgotten
in the wake of days gone by
and what, pray tell, lives in a heart
that never dreams at all?
a bitter, lonely soul it seems
that hides behind a wall
and as the wall stands firm
and lets no other heart come near
it feels not love and laughter
from the ones it should hold dear
in time the wall will crumble
giving way to love's pure light
then once again the heart will dream
and fly to greater heights.
love poems index
you brought happiness into my lonely heart
you brought emotions alive again
you were not prepared what we were to start
you were not ready for what was to begin
you saw my pain and my sorrow
you made me look forward to another tomorrow
you made me laugh and you made me cry
but most of all you made me feel alive.
when i close my eyes
to sleep at night
it's you i see
holding me tight.
your arms so strong
you make me feel safe
the only thing wrong
someone else has your place.
i know it is wrong
to be dreaming of you
but my heart just can't stop
these feelings so true.
the timing was wrong
i met you too late
a promise was made
to determine my fate.
why weren't you there
when i had the chance
i will always regret
not getting this dance.
and so for now
i will settle for two
but in my heart
it will always be you.
you've changed my whole life around
you've picked me up from where i fell down
you've made me strong when i was weak
all our promises, i pomise to keep
you've taught the truth behind my lies
you've been the tears behind my cries
you've been the blanket that keeps me warm
you've been the shelter during our storm
you've been my aid to learning what's new
you've been my experience from what we've been through
you've shown me emotions i never thought i'd feel
for all this, i know my feelings are real
my one wish, that i pray stays true
my love, i hope, forever, you.
you and me
you and me,
together forever we will be;
as long as there is heaven and hell,
we will always be well;
every time i look into your eyes,
i know my heart never lies;
about the way my love for you is true,
and for that love of you anything i would do;
when i feel the sweet feel of your touch,
it just makes me want you so much;
inside my arms,
so i may protect you from all harms;
even when the world is over,
only one thing will still hover;
and that thing will always be,
the love between you and me.
you are always there
if i've ever felt apart from the world...
you brought me back
if i've ever cried my eyes out...
you've made them stop
if i've felt fear has kidnapped my heart...
you've rescued me
if i've ever felt deep misery or loneliness in my eyes...
you've filled them with hope and sincerity
if i've ever run away from all that i was afraid of...
you've showed that me i need to face them
if i've ever hidden from the crazy side of my mind...
you've showed me light
if i've ever been torn or bent...
you've straightened me out
if i've lost pieces to my heart...
afraid that they wouldn't be put back together...
you've been there to show me it's never lost.
you are my dream come true
always in my heart
you make me feel more loved
than i've ever felt
and happier than i've ever dreamed.
the love and understanding you have
is something i have searched for
my entire life.
always in my happiest
and saddest moments,
you are my best friend and confidante.
i come to you for everything,
and you listen to me without judgment.
always, deep within my soul,
i know we have a love like no other.
what we share is something others
only hope for and dream of,
but few ever experience.
our love is magical beyond belief.
always, without hesitation,
you give of yourself completely.
you have reached the very depths of my soul,
bringing out emotions i never knew i had
and unveiling an ability to love
i never thought possible.
always and forever
you will be my dream come true,
the one i have waited for all these years.
from now until the end of time,
i will love only you.
we will be together always.
you are my hope
you are the beat of my heart,
you are the blood in my veins,
you are the life of my body,
you are the spirit in my soul.
you have givin me hope,
when i thought i could not cope,
in a time when i felt i was at the end of my rope.
i am in love with you, and only you,
for you are truly the love of my life.
your smile starts my heart to sing,
and how i can hear the bells start to ring.
for when im with you i feel nothing amiss,
and thats because of your loving kiss.
i stare at you face and i get lost in your beauty,
and my love for you will never become a duty.
to have you at my side,
through our lifes joyful ride,
fills my heart with passion and pride.
dont ever forget my love for you,
for without your love i'd have no clue.
you are on my mind
it makes me happy just being by your side
all those feelings i just can't hide
you'll always be in my heart
can't bear the pain when were apart
nobody is as special as you are to me
now i hope you are beginning to see
just how much i care for you
and all my feelings will always be true
i can't describe how much i care
but when you need me, i will be there
to wipe those tears when you are sad
to make you happy when you are mad
all these things i really can do
just remember i'm thinking of you
you are on my mind 24-7.

whispers of the night
you are the one
i try to find the words
to express the feeling in my heart;
i try to show you that i care,
but i don't know where to start.
i guess i'll start right here
and i guess i'll start right now.
i'll tell you that i love you
and i'll tell you why and how.
you are the one i want to lay next to
when my time has passed.
you are the one i've given myself to
and you will be the last.
you are the one i want for life,
until the day i die.
you are the one god sent for me,
to be with me, and that is no lie.
you are the one who brightens my day,
with your smile bright and glowing.
you are the one whom i wake up for
each and every morning.
you are the one for me
your the one for me
in my heart i feel like we were meant to be
no one has ever made me feel the way i do
but thats was way before i met you
i've never fallen in love so fast
i just hope this feeling will last
your the one i've been searching for my whole life
and one of these years i wish to be your wife
i hope you feel the way i feel
because all of this just seems
to wonderful to be real.

you're the one
there`s a strange feeling
hidden inside my heart
there`s a strange feeling
stored up inside my heart
i crave for love no matter
i long eagerly for love
even though it hurts
i`ll wait for you though
it takes so many nights
i`ll save my last breath until
the sun refuse to shine its light
i want you to know
i need you to know
for you i will show that
you`re the one i cant let go.
you'll love me yet
you'll love me yet!--and i can tarry
your love's protracted growing;
june rear'd that bunch of flowers you carry
from seeds of april's sowing.
i plant a heartful now: some seed
at least is sure to strike,
and yield--what you'll not pluck indeed,
not love, but, may be, like.
you'll look at least on love's remains,
a grave's one violet:
your look?--that pays a thousand pains.
what's death?  you'll love me yet!
younger than spring time
it's sunny and bright all the day long
now i'm certain that you adore me,
down lover's lane, singing our song,
we meet in the early morning.
we stay awhile on the grass so green,
you tell me of love's old story,
you tell me over, and over again,
kisses are sweet in the early morning.
you're my angel in disguise
god saw you suffering,
and said come with me to a better place.
he took your hand and said " walk with me"
i'll heal your dreary face.
i'm taking you to a place,
where i can take care of you,
a place where you can run and play
where you can do what you want to do.
as you say your last words to me,
tears fell from my eyes,
you reached up took my hand,
and said "please don't cry"
do not cry for me for i am in a better place.
i will look down and watch you,
i will guide your heavenly face.
as i slowly touch your face,
you slowly passed away
i try to hold back my tears,
for i will be with you one day.
as i slowly kiss your forehead,
i slowly start to cry,
you whispered in my ear
"i will always love you"
"you're my angel in disguise.

i see it in your face
i ask myself is it really there?
i ask you and you say nothing at all
i wonder have you ever felt this way before?
i hear your heart beat and you say nothing at all
i see a twinkle in your eyes
i guess you feel it too, don't you?
i feel your hand in mine
i see cupid's arrow of love just hit you
i ask you "can you feel it?"
i hear those words " i love you"

happiness and joy are just some things
that an angel can give

your eyes are like sapphires that shine bright.
when everything is dark, you give me light.
you're an angel that gives me a reason to live,
you're an angel that teaches me to give.
you're an angel that teaches me the right things to say.
you're my angel & ill always care.

you have brought back,
those loving arms,
that holds me tight.
you have brought back,
those tender lips, that kisses mine.
you have brought back,
that loving smile,
that never left me.
you have brought back,
a new start,
to another love.
you have come back
and with you,
you brought love.
your smile, so nice
your love, so tender
you bring my life all together
your hugs, so grand
your kisses, so sweet
you make my heart skip a beat
your heart, so warm
your touch, so soft
you stole my love on the spot.
you pulled me together,
and skipped along.
then you had me... from that moment on.
like so much wine
you intoxicate me
your smile weakens my body
your voice makes my world spin
my high is heightened by your touch
my obsession for your wide brown eyes
traps me in my stand of stillness
and just like an inmate i am your prisoner
i am a fiend -
waiting to cop every ounce
ounce of your goods
down to your last ounce of intimacy
they say time -
only time can heal a drunken body
for it is not my body but my soul that is drunk and -
being without you is like drinking tequila with no lime
i am amazed by the presence of you
enticed by your scent of masculinity
i am pleased with the satisfaction you present me
delirious and out of control
i need to feel your presence upon me
and together our love will forever hold
a feeling and promise made anew until eternity
i have none, but doubts
at times there are some
after your kiss i am without
i am surrounded by images of you
presumptuous about the night before
one more ounce-deja vu
like so much wine
you intoxicate me
like the poisoned grape of the vine
its just the inebriated love of thee.

i love your eyes, those twinkling eyes,
they speak of a thousand things.
it glows and i drown in its intensity,
i would love to stay there forever.
it evokes myriad memories,
and leaves an imprint on me.
i consider myself lucky enough,
to have experienced its warmth.
when cupid's arrow strikes,
the world seems apparelled in celestial light,
like the glory and freshness of your eyes.
just like the morning dew,
exotic and beautiful.
every time i look into your eyes,
i'm lost in innumerable memories,
thus forgetting the world behind me.
i wouldn't expect anything much,
than just being the apple of your eye!
one glance from her eyes
so dark and so brown,
put him under her spell,
his world spun around
one smile from her lips,
his heart skipped a beat,
her womanly spell,
knocked him right off his feet
one word, just one look,
he flew out of control,
and her magical spell,
touched the heart of his soul
her voice of pure velvet,
his thoughts were now drifting,
her magic and laughter,
her joy so uplifting
for her magic, her charms,
her feminine ways,
would enchant him would capture him,
all of his days
his heart was now hers,
his love hers to keep,
for the power of her magic,
that moved him so deep
for the love in her eyes,
sent him out of control,
and her magical spell,
played the harp of his soul.
unimaginable to queens and doves
i was caught between soft gasps of delight
and the privileged serenity
of taking in your smile
that solicitous smile
delivered hope to my soul
when soft swept words carried
dusk into nocturnal magic
then a trickle of light nestled your hair
and i waited for the wind
and tiny bells to ring
the anticipating sound of surrender.
your smile lights up my day. keep smiling. ~ gabor timis
your smile, your touch, your heart
your smile awakens my soul,
as the sun awakens the day.
a kiss and my life is yours,
it seems a fair price to pay.
your touch arouses my senses,
as the moon arouses the night.
hold me and win me forever,
in your arms all things are right.
your heart endures all emotion,
as the sky endures all the stars.
love me and we'll have eternity,
there is no greater love than ours.
love poems index
to hear your sweet voice in the early dawn,
gives to my heart a feeling thats warm,
and starts my day with my thoughts in a swarm.
to wake to the ring of the phone,
and know that i will not be alone,
for together we have joined our souls,
so we may help each other to fulfill our goals.
my love you is true and sure,
and you make my life feel pure,
since we have started this wonderful tour.
you were once
i once loved you so much
and for so long.
why did you leave
when i did nothing wrong?
your smile was once the sun
on a dark, rainy day.
it would clear up the sky
and keep it from being gray.
your eyes were once the shine
of the world's glowing light.
or were they the twinkling stars
that once filled the night?
your hands once had power
to give me the softest touch.
they'd always give me a slight tingle,
which is why i loved them so much.
your hugs were once the medicine
that'd change a frown to cheer.
a shiver would run through my body
every time i feel your love near.
your kisses were once the wind,
they were fresh and breezy against my face.
they were gentle, so gentle,
it's something no one will replace.
but, now you like someone else,
and it's driving me insane.
although it's over for us,
the love we had still remains.
and so i tell myself...
never again will i cry.
you were once everything to me,
that i can't deny.
but i couldn't keep my promise
and broke out in tears.
the hours i've cried feel like days,
the days feel like years.
as i bury my face in the pillow,
and cry my heart out and grieve,
i've learned to never give away love
if love i don't receive.
