# botathon_story_game

Our Bot is primarily meant for entertainment of Kids. KIds will be able to interact with the bot and create stories and poems. The sentences generated will contain words from famous fairy tales/ poems that kids love. The story/poem that get generated will be a combination of different stories keeping the context intact and thus making it interesting. We are also focusing on parameters like rhyming-words to make it more interesting. We are also creating some characters like "Yoda" and talk their grammar. We have collected a large amount of data from various novels, poems, fairytales text available online and using those for the purpose of training our bots. Language Modeling, string matching, sequence of actions, phonetic matching, memory based language generation, Clause Boundary Detection are some of the highlights of the technologies being used.
